The study found that intrinsic motivation had a strong cor- relation with programming performance as did self-efficacy for learning and per- formance, r=0.512, p {\textless}0.01 and r=0.567, p {\textless}0.01 respectively. Aspects of comfort level were found to have significant correlations with performance with an instrument on programming-esteem rendering the most interesting results. A regression model based upon these factors was able to account for 60{\%} of the variance},

abstract = {Context-aware e-learning is an educational model that foresees the selection of learning resources to make the e-learning content more relevant and suitable for the learner in his/her situation. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that an ontological approach can be used to define leaning contexts and to allow contextualizing learning experiences finding out relevant topics for each context. To do that, we defined a context model able to formally describe a learning context, an ontology-based model enabling the representation of a teaching domain (including context information) and a methodology to generate personalized and context-aware learning experiences starting from them. Based on these theoretical components we improved an existing system for personalized e-learning with contextualisation features and experimented it with real users in two University courses. The results obtained from this experimentation have been compared with those achieved by similar systems.},

The root-mean-square (RMS) of the third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order Zernike coefficients (total HOAs), the RMS of the third-order Zernike coefficients (S3) (coma-like aberration), the RMS of the fourth-order coefficients (S4) (spherical-like aberrations), and the area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) were evaluated.{\$}\backslash{\$}n{\$}\backslash{\$}nRESULTS: The AULCSF in the KC-RGP group was significantly lower than in the other two groups.

abstract = {Programming is a fundamental part of computer science curriculum, but it is often problematic. The high drop out and failure rates in introductory programming courses are a universal problem that motivated many researchers to propose methodologies and tools to help students. Although some of these tools have been reported to have a positive effect in students learning, the problem still remains mostly unsolved. We think that there are several reasons that cause this learning problem. Maybe the most important is the lack of problem solving abilities that many students show. They don't know how to program, because they don't know how to create algorithms, mainly due to their lack of general problem solving abilities. This and other causes to student difficulties are discussed in this paper. Some possible solutions are proposed, so that problems can be reduced.},

Students in this course were enrolled in two sections randomly, one section was considered the treatment group where we implemented these strategies, while the other section represented the control group. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these strategies, we used indirect and direct assessments. Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire(MSLQ) was used as indirect assessment to assess students' awareness of SRL skills in the treatment group comparing to others in the control group. Students performance in both groups was used as direct assessment. The results show that these strategies improve students' Self-regulation in learning computer programing, consequently students who were trained on using SRL skills outperformed those who were not.},

abstract = {In the context of lifelong learning, learning networks are emerged as alternative and feasible integrated models that merge pedagogical, organizational, and technological perspectives to support and promote the provision of lifelong learning opportunities. Among the significant issues that arise when setting up a learning network is the question of how to support communication between repositories that employ different schemes for describing learner profiles. To guarantee correct interpretation, a semantic common metadata schema is required. This paper aims to propose an ontological structure for representing a learner profile that augments it with semantics and provides a common vocabulary for the exchange of the different learner's characteristics that can be presented in a learner model. The proposed structure is based on different learner information with respect to well-known learner model specifications. Besides, it reuses terms from well-developed Semantic Web vocabularies which make it semantic web compliant and integrates different domain taxonomies and subject taxonomies that are used as ranges for particular concepts' slots.},

We have implemented a Personalised Adaptive e-Learning system (onto-PAdeL) which uses an ontological approach in designing learners' models. Thus, this paper focuses on describing our approach for modelling learners based on their characteristics such as abilities, learning style(s), prior knowledge and preferences. The system uses Item Response Theory (IRT) for calculating learner's abilities. The learning style can be represented according to different theories, each of which supports personalisation in different ways. We show that using ontologies for learner modelling, in addition to many different benefits, enables reasoning for adaptive learning.},

A true experimental design was used in the study. Four randomly-assigned groups participated in the study: a traditional collaborative learning group (TCLG, 34 students), an innovative collaborative learning group (ICLG, 31 students), a CALL traditional collaborative learning group (CALLTCLG, 32 students), and a CALL innovative collaborative learning group (CALLICLG, 31 students). TOEIC (Test of English for International Communication) listening, reading, speaking, and writing pre-test and post-test assessments were given to all students at an interval of sixteen weeks. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA), multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyze the data. The results revealed that students who used CALL had significantly better learning performance than those who did not. Students in innovative collaborative learning had significantly better learning performances than those in traditional collaborative learning.

abstract = {With the aim of characterizing self-regulated learning of engineering students in a Colombian university, students were asked to answer a Spanish version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ); this questionnaire enables obtaining information on epistemic motivation and learning strategies of the students in the courses they are studying. The data found suggest the dimensional structure of the questionnaire did not meet the context of those students. It was decided to make a new translation of the MSLQ into Spanish and make linguistic and cultural adaptations in order to achieve a valid instrument; this work began with the International Test Commission (ITC) guidelines. As a result, a new questionnaire was attained, MSLQ-Colombia. The objective of this article is to present the method used to obtain the MSLQ-Colombia, and the study of the psychometric properties of the new questionnaire. The psychometric properties studied were the construct validity, content validity and reliability. These properties were determined by factor analysis, Cronbach's Alpha and experts consultation. The participants of this research were 1218 engineering students and 12 university teachers. The results indicate the new questionnaire is valid and reliable, provide information to those who may use MSLQ-Colombia to comprehend the results of their investigations, and offer the international community new empirical evidences on MSLQ psychometric properties. It led to the conclusion that the MSLQ-Colombia has similar psychometric properties to the original MSLQ in English, and that the new questionnaire can be useful for the Spanish speaking international community. This article can be a valuable guide for those researchers, who desire making translations-adaptations of the MSLQ into languages-cultures different from English or Spanish, and also, to translate-adapt questionnaires of self-report besides the MSLQ.},

abstract = {As an important coordination and cooperation mechanism in multi-agent systems, coalition of agents exhibits some excellent characteristics and draws researchers' attention increasingly. Cooperation formation has been a very active area of research in multi-agent systems. An efficient algorithm is needed for this topic since the numbers of the possible coalitions are exponential in the number of agents. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been widely reckoned as a useful tool for obtaining high quality and optimal solutions for a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems due to its intelligent advantages of self-organization, self-adaptation and inherent parallelism. This paper proposes a GA-based algorithm for coalition structure formation which aims at achieving goals of high performance, scalability, and fast convergence rate simultaneously. A novel 2D binary chromosome encoding approach and corresponding crossover and mutation operators are presented in this paper. Two valid parental chromosomes are certain to produce a valid offspring under the operation of the crossover operator. This improves the efficiency and shortens the running time greatly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through a robust comparison with heuristic search algorithms. We have confirmed that our new algorithm is robust, self-adaptive and very efficient by experiments. The results of the proposed algorithm are found to be satisfactory. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {I-MINDS provides a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) infrastructure and environment for learners in synchronous learning and classroom management applications for instructors, for large classroom or distance education situations. For supporting the instructor, I-MINDS includes a teacher agent. The teacher agent allows the instructor to interact with students, manage Q{\&}A sessions, administer quizzes, post evaluations, form groups and monitor individual and group performances. For computer-supported collaborative learning, I-MINDS, which stands for Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed Systems in Education, provides a student agent for each student. Each student agent monitors and models its user and carries out group formation with other student agents behind-the-scene. I-MINDS provides standard online collaborative features such as chat rooms and whiteboards and implements a structured cooperative learning mechanism called Jigsaw. The system also incorporates multiagent coalition formation algorithms for forming peer groups. I-MINDS also provides a group agent for each peer group that monitors and evaluates its assigned peer group. I-MINDS has been deployed and evaluated in an introductory computer science course (CS1). Results show that intelligent tools such as I-MINDS can be used in a real-time environment to support student cooperative learning activities, and also as a testbed to collect instructional or pedagogical data for better understanding of student collaborative learning. This paper describes the I-MINDS framework, implementation, deployment, and test results comprehensively.},

abstract = {Computer science education, CS1, Bayesian networks Researchers have long tried to identify factors that could explain why programming is easier for some than the others or that can be used to predict programming performance. The motivation behind most studies has been identifying students who are at risk to fail and improving passing rates on introductory courses as these have a direct impact on retention rates. Various potential factors have been identified, and these include factors related to students' background, programming behavior or psychological and cognitive characteristics. However, the results have been inconsistent. This thesis replicates some of these previous studies in a new context, and pairwise analyses of various factors and performance are performed. We have data collected from 3 different cohorts of an introductory Java programming course that contains a large number of exercises and where personal assistance is available. In addition, this thesis contributes to the topic by modeling the dependencies between several of these factors. This is done by learning a Bayesian network from the data. We will then evaluate these networks by trying to predict whether students will pass or fail the course. The focus is on factors related to students' background and psychological and cognitive characteristics. No clear predictors were identified in this study. We were able to find weak correlations between some of the factors and programming performance. However, in general, the correlations we found were smaller than in previous studies or nonexistent. In addition, finding just one optimal network that describes the domain is not straightforward , and the classification rates obtained were poor. Thus, the results suggest that factors related to students' background and psychological and cognitive characteristics that were included in this study are not good predictors of programming performance in our context.},

abstract = {The data about high students' failure rates in introductory programming courses have been alarming many educators, raising a number of important questions regarding prediction aspects. In this paper, we present a comparative study on the effectiveness of educational data mining techniques to early predict students likely to fail in introductory programming courses. Although several works have analyzed these techniques to identify students' academic failures, our study differs from existing ones as follows: (i) we investigate the effectiveness of such techniques to identify students likely to fail at early enough stage for action to be taken to reduce the failure rate; (ii) we analyse the impact of data preprocessing and algorithms fine-tuning tasks, on the effectiveness of the mentioned techniques. In our study we evaluated the effectiveness of four prediction techniques on two different and independent data sources on introductory programming courses available from a Brazilian Public University: one comes from distance education and the other from on-campus. The results showed that the techniques analyzed in our study are able to early identify students likely to fail, the effectiveness of some of these techniques is improved after applying the data preprocessing and/or algorithms fine-tuning, and the support vector machine technique outperforms the other ones in a statistically significant way.},

In this analysis, 425 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2016 were extracted and coded, and these generated the following findings. First, the collaboration had significant positive effects on knowledge gain (ES [effect size] = 0.42), skill acquisition (ES = 0.64), and student perceptions (ES = 0.38) in computer-based learning conditions. Second, computer use led to positive effects on knowledge gain (ES = 0.45), skill acquisition (ES = 0.53), student perceptions (ES = 0.51), group task performance (ES = 0.89), and social interaction (ES = 0.57) in collaborative learning contexts. Third, the use of extra learning environments or tools produced a medium effect for knowledge gain (ES = 0.55), and supportin...},

@article{Hampton1993,
abstract = {Five main sections deal with evidence leading to the prototype view, a description of the "standard" prototype model, connections to some relevant data-analytic methods, advantages of prototype models, and inadequacies of the prototype view. Conclusion identifies theory-based view and exemplar as chief rivals to prototype view, advocates for integration of all of these. Sees prototype theory as fitting between the abstract models of categorization of theories and frames, and the concrete approach to exemplars. Includes in the standard prototype model the differential weighting of attribute values and of attributes themselves, as well as a similarity scale, a criterion (cutoff for category membership), and typicality, which author chooses to apply only within a category. Maintains that "Degree of category membership (as defined by... probability of a positive classification) and rated typicality are both derived directly from the underlying similarity scale, but are not identical - a frequent source of misunderstanding" (75). Acknowledges both within-subject instability (71) and between-subject variability (76). Notes that much of Rosch's conjectures about how categories are formed can be modeled using data-analytic methods, such as Latent Class Analysis. Advantages of prototype view are that it explains a wide variety of phenomena reported in linguistics (Lakoff 1987), anthropology, and psychiatry; also that it is a flexible model, capable of incorporating new information as it comes in and changing over time. "As we then learn more about which attributes are most central (in terms of their correlation with all the others), we can readjust the attribute-value weights, and introduce new attributes based on more subtle aspects of the objects in the domain, in a gradual way" (80). MOST HELPFUL AS A MODEL OF MUSICAL GENRE-LEARNING! Three major objections to the prototype model are the problem of complex concepts ("pet fish"), over-generality, and over-emphasis on abstract types over the role of exemplars in categorization. Author's own research has shown that the complex concept problem can be partially solved by viewing concept combination at the level of intension rather than extension, and a willingness to drop some attributes from the union of the two attribute sets. Notes that there are still things left to explain, like how new attributes arise in combination that don't exist in either of the parent categories, e.g. pet birds live in cages. The charge that prototype theory explains too much must be answered by "an independent account of how attributes are selected and how attribute-value weights are determined," the idea being to reduce eliminate a large portion of "conceptual structures, most of which never occur naturally" (85). Outlines two types of "independent accounts," the first a "bottom-up" account based on Gibson's theories of perception and on Rosch's thoughts on how basic-level categories arise. This passage (p. 86) is the clearest explanation of basic level yet, and contains more gist for A MODEL OF MUSICAL GENRE-LEARNING! The other type of account is "top-down" (frames and theories), and also describes mechanisms for genre-learning, as classification of instances gives way to reasoning based on theories that account of properties of things not directly observable: "The search for a stable conceptual system, in which useful generalizations can be made, leads to concepts based on more stable abstract properties" (87). The challenge of the "exemplar-based models" is that prototype effects can be explained not by comparison to a central tendency, but by similarity to certain individual instances. Evidence comes from artificial classification experiments and from connectionist research. Treating a small group of exemplars as central is a tenable compromise solution. Similarity calculation to an exemplar is problematic without the analysis of attributes that lead back to the idea of a central tendency.},

Apply basic concepts and design relatively simple algorithms, appear to be somewhat dificult for the student. Based on the observations of various authors, this may be due to various factors such as motivation, learning styles, experience, etc. To determine the dificulties of the students were applied two instruments: the irst in order to determine the learning styles of the students who entered in 2012 and the second one to determine which were the topics that caused more problems during the process and gets their preferences in the study. The results show that students have preferences for the visual materials, exercise guides and example programs, which is proper of the learning styles of them. RESUMEN La ense{\~{n}}anza de los Fundamentos de Programaci{\'{o}}n es una parte esencial de un curriculum en Ciencias de la Computaci{\'{o}}n, sin embargo para la mayor{\'{i}}a de las carreras se transforma en un aspecto problem{\'{a}}tico. El aplicar conceptos b{\'{a}}sicos o dise{\~{n}}ar algoritmos relativamente simples parece ser algo dif{\'{i}}cil para el estudiante. De acuerdo a lo expuesto por diversos autores, esto se puede deber a diversos factores, tales como motivaci{\'{o}}n, estilos de aprendizaje diferentes, experiencia previa, entre otros. Para determinar las diicultades nuestros estudiantes se aplicaron dos instrumentos: el primero con el in de determinar los estilos de aprendizajes de los alumnos a{\~{n}}o de ingreso 2012 y el segundo para determinar cuales fueron los t{\'{o}}picos que les provocaron m{\'{a}}s problemas durante el proceso y obtener sus preferencias en el estudio. Los resultados muestran que aquellos estudiantes poseen preferencias por el material visual, gu{\'{i}}as de ejercicios y programas de ejemplo, algo que es propio al estilo de aprendizajes de ellos. PALABRAS CLAVE Estilos de Aprendizaje, Estilos de Ense{\~{n}}anza, Fundamentos de Programaci{\'{o}}n. INTRODUCCI{\'{O}}N En la actualidad la ense{\~{n}}anza de la programaci{\'{o}}n es un tema de suma importancia en las carreras de Ingenier{\'{i}}a ligadas a las tecnolog{\'{i}}as [1]. En los {\'{u}}ltimos a{\~{n}}os se han propuesto muchos enfoques y herramientas distintas, sin embargo a la fecha no parece existir un enfoque o una soluci{\'{o}}n completamente satisfactoria [2]. La aplicaci{\'{o}}n de conceptos b{\'{a}}sicos o el dise{\~{n}}o de algoritmos que son relativamente simples para los docentes, parece ser algo dif{\'{i}}cil para el estudiante [3]. Estas diicultades se maniiestan independiente del paradigma y/o lenguaje utilizado. Esto se puede deber a diversos factores, tales como motivaci{\'{o}}n, estilos de aprendizajes diferentes, experiencia previa, entre otros [4], [5], [6]. La deserci{\'{o}}n, cercana al 47{\%} que se produce en los primeros a{\~{n}}os de ingenier{\'{i}}a, provocan necesariamente mirar en forma anal{\'{i}}tica este fen{\'{o}}meno [7]. La carrera de Ingenier{\'{i}}a Civil en Inform{\'{a}}tica de la Universidad de Valpara{\'{i}}so, impartida desde el a{\~{n}}o 2005, no es ajena a esta situaci{\'{o}}n. En ella se han realizado esfuerzos constantes para mejorar dicha problem{\'{a}}tica, como por ejemplo incorporaci{\'{o}}n de nuevas herramientas [8], actualizaci{\'{o}}n de planes de estudio o nivelaci{\'{o}}n de alumnos de primer a{\~{n}}o.

An engineer must be able to portray ideas, test them and create new software applications. The objective of this research is to determine the barriers and sort them in order to create strategies to help and facilitate the development of coding skills in students of different engineering programs. The project was done with students of the second semester of computer systems and electromechanical engineering programs. Students were asked to describe the different barriers they had faced and how they had solved that situation. These descriptions were classified. It is important to highlight that regardless of the students' background, they presented similar barriers.},

abstract = {Although there is a growing interest in learning to program, the number of women involved in programming remains surprisingly low. We don't understand completely the causes but it has become clear that men and women have different perceptions of programming. The pedagogy of introductory programming courses should take these differences into account. In this study we analyze gender differences in an introductory programming course at the university level. Our results indicate that male and female students have different perceptions and learning outcomes: male students find programming easier, have a higher intention to program in the future and show higher learning outcomes than female students. To reduce these differences we have designed and implemented several learning modules using the principles of physical computing. The physical computing approach aims to take computational concepts out of the screen and into the real world so that students can interact with them. We have applied these modules in a MATLAB introductory programming course in a biology degree. When using these modules both male and female students showed similar results in perceptions and learning outcomes. The use of physical computing principles in combination with the traditional methodology reduced -actually closed- this gender gap.},

abstract = {In order to develop our view of the revolution that technology is creating in education, it is helpful to briefly consider how technology has revolutionized American culture, and how it has left our educators rushing to catch up. In barely 20 years, electronic technology has dramatically penetrated into every area of society, and every aspect of our social and cultural lives. Television was the initiator. Broadcast images inaugurated a new, immediate, and powerful way of experiencing ideas and events. Television rediscovered and recast the world as a direct experience, and liberated it from the confines of text and static illustrations. It became possible for events a world away to appear in our homes, with all their intensity and vividness intact. Computers made it possible for vast amounts of information, from airline reservations to the contents of encyclopedias, to be made instantly available and modified with a keystroke. Writing became a matter of screens and printers, and text became permanently flexible, always ready to be instantly changed. The very nature of work changed, with an increasing demand for workers who could master the new technologies and use them to conduct business that formerly did not require computers at all. Most significant, however, are the changes wrought in our children by the technological revolution. Children have grown up with remote controls, and spend more time watching television and video tapes than reading. Toys are now filled with buttons and blinking lights. They talk and listen, and interact with children, responding to them in ways the stuffed animals and hobby horses of the past did not. Pinball arcades, the quintessential teenage amusement, have become blooming, buzzing multimedia centers where TV images dance at the command of the user. Computer-based information kiosks have become a common feature of malls, museums, and other public places. Atari and Nintendo ultimately brought electronic entertainment right into the living room, making interactive technology as common in the home as television had been in the past. Our children have been raised in a world of instant access to knowledge, a world where vivid images embody and supplement information formerly presented solely through text. They are used to an environment where they control information flow and access,},

abstract = {In this paper we argue for using a “Game First” approach to teaching introductory programming. We believe that concerns over whether an OO approach or a procedural approach should be used first are secondary to the course assignment and example content. If examples are not compelling, student interest often lags thus making the OO versus procedural argument moot. We believe that game programming motivates most new programmers. Compelling assignments mean that students are far more likely to learn because they are interested, and the visual component allows students to see mistakes in their code as manifested in the resultant graphics. We describe our experiences after redesigning and offering a new introductory computer science sequence using 2D game development as a unifying theme. We teach fundamental programming concepts via two dimensional game development in Flash and ActionScript during the first quarter, transition to C++ to solidify concepts and add pointers during the second quarter, then teach a multi-phase project based game approach using C++ and openGL (2D graphics only) during the third quarter. Our surveys show that this approach improved student understanding of all seven basic topics examined.},

abstract = {I propose a rather simple framework within which to consider the very wide range of existing online courses. The mystification surrounding the term "online course" arises because it is used indiscriminately to apply to nearly any course that makes even a passing use of the Internet, as well as to those where every aspect of the course is only accessible electronically. Of course categories are invidious to many who immediately cite applications that do not fit easily into the framework. Nevertheless, I think it is useful to begin to define the online educational world if only for others to redefine for themselves.},

Thus, this paper focuses on describing our approach for modelling learners based on their characteristics such as abilities, learning style(s), prior knowledge and preferences. The system uses Item Response Theory (IRT) for calculating learner's abilities. The learning style can be represented according to different theories, each of which supports personalisation in different ways. We show that using ontologies for learner modelling, in addition to many different benefits, enables reasoning for adaptive learning.},

Among the significant issues that arise when setting up a learning network is the question of how to support communication between repositories that employ different schemes for describing learner profiles. To guarantee correct interpretation, a semantic common metadata schema is required. This paper aims to propose an ontological structure for representing a learner profile that augments it with semantics and provides a common vocabulary for the exchange of the different learner's characteristics that can be presented in a learner model. The proposed structure is based on different learner information with respect to well-known learner model specifications. Besides, it reuses terms from well-developed Semantic Web vocabularies which make it semantic web compliant and integrates different domain taxonomies and subject taxonomies that are used as ranges for particular concepts' slots.},

To do that, we defined a context model able to formally describe a learning context, an ontology-based model enabling the representation of a teaching domain (including context information) and a methodology to generate personalized and context-aware learning experiences starting from them. Based on these theoretical components we improved an existing system for personalized e-learning with contextualisation features and experimented it with real users in two University courses. The results obtained from this experimentation have been compared with those achieved by similar systems.},

The root-mean-square (RMS) of the third-, fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-order Zernike coefficients (total HOAs), the RMS of the third-order Zernike coefficients (S3) (coma-like aberration), the RMS of the fourth-order coefficients (S4) (spherical-like aberrations), and the area under the log contrast sensitivity function (AULCSF) were evaluated.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The AULCSF in the KC-RGP group was significantly lower than in the other two groups.

abstract = {Self and peer-assessment are becoming central aspects of student-centred assessment processes in higher education. Despite increasing evidence that both forms of assessment are helpful for developing key capabilities in students, such as taking more responsibility for their own learning, developing a better understanding of the subject matter, assessment criteria and their own values and judgements, and developing critical reflection skills, both forms of assessment are still not the norm at universities. This paper provides the findings of a two-year study of formative self and peer-assessment at an Australian university. The study supports other research showing that students tend to regard formative self and peer-assessment as beneficial for gaining more insights about the assessment process and for improving their own work. We argue that self and peer-assessment requires careful design and implementation for it to be an effective tool for formative assessment processes; and that the development of students' capacities for giving feedback, and the continuous and timely involvement of the teacher, are central aspects for successful self and peer-assessment. The move to self and peer-assessment is not simple for teachers and students but is worthwhile and necessary for twenty-first century higher education.},

The paper presents an interesting and topical account of the use of OTs in an accounting course over an extended period. However, his applied use of learning styles and the Learning Styles Questionnaire (LSQ) in this context is methodologically questionable.

abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse-definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects-is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present our experience in a Computer Science (CS) introductory course, where three teaching practices were implemented and compared: lectured-based learning, problem-based learning, and peer instruction. We chose Information Systems, a first-term undergraduate course, for this study. It overviews a variety of topics in CS, such as algorithms, data structures and programming logic. We initially conducted interviews with previous instructors, who assisted in the collection of data, requirements, and needs pertaining to both students and instructors. We also carried out a survey among students enrolled in the program, in order to identify suggestions on how the classes could become more dynamic and motivating. In sequence, the experiment was designed to format and evaluate classes in the chosen paradigms. We focused on assessing and analyzing how the students' motivation and learning process were affected, as well as how difficult it was for instructors to prepare classes and how much time they expended in doing so. Results indicate that a paradigm shift from traditional teaching is not only expected by students and instructor; it is well received, and had a positive influence on the students' learning and motivation. We also found, however, that the proposed changes brought on an unwelcome overhead for the instructors, as additional time and effort are required to implement such practices.},

abstract = {Flipped learning is a pedagogical approach that uses technology to deliver instructional content outside of class (individual space) and class time to engage in collaborative activities (group space). In a flipped learning course, the traditional classroom paradigm shifts and teachers become more facilitator than lecturer. Research on flipped learning is limited, in that studies are mostly conducted in postsecondary classrooms and focus on engagement and performance rather than the learning that occurs during collaboration. My study was designed to investigate group learning or knowledge construction during collaborative activities. Participants were middle school students from Hawaii. To identify group learning, I targeted a specific activity between three students in the group space. Using a computer‐supported collaborative learning framework, I recorded and analysed the group's verbal communication as they worked together. Moments of knowledge construction and interactions leading to those moments were analysed. Content analysis and lag sequential analysis revealed significant strategies used by students to construct knowledge. Some recommendations for practitioners include designing a need for teacher facilitation, incorporating questions that promote student discussion, and requiring students to reflect on their understanding. Future studies should include different K‐12 environments and focus on knowledge construction transfer between the individual and group learning spaces.

All three entities of the didactic triangle (student, instructor, and content) together with learning context were incorporated into the research design to understand the problem better and execute the proposed solution. The result shows that three cycles of the action research methodology helps in understanding and improving the students learning outcomes in the IP course.

The high drop out and failure rates in introductory programming courses are a universal problem that motivated many researchers to propose methodologies and tools to help students. Although some of these tools have been reported to have a positive effect in students learning, the problem still remains mostly unsolved. We think that there are several reasons that cause this learning problem. Maybe the most important is the lack of problem solving abilities that many students show. They don't know how to program, because they don't know how to create algorithms, mainly due to their lack of general problem solving abilities. This and other causes to student difficulties are discussed in this paper. Some possible solutions are proposed, so that problems can be reduced.},

Otra caracter{\'{i}}stica que mejora el proceso de aprendizaje es la sociabilidad. Por medio de las interacciones sociales se adquirieren diferentes habilidades y se fomentan, entre otras cosas, las actitudes de respeto y tolerancia [3]. En el caso de la educaci{\'{o}}n, la interacci{\'{o}}n social permite a los estudiantes tener diferentes visiones del concepto que est{\'{a}}n estudiando y como consecuencia, se disminuye la tendencia a simplificar los conceptos complejos durante el proceso de aprendizaje.

ABsTRACT We are at the beginning of a new evolution because of the development of Information Technology and Communication (ICT), and their introduction and intensive use in social dynamics and educational reality. This advance of digital technology has created environments that greatly favor social interaction. In recent years, new trends have emerged in e-learning as mobile learning, the model " Flipped Classroom " , massive open online courses, personal learning environments, game-based learning and learning analytics; in all of them, the collaborative learning is strengthened. In addition, some negative effects that can be caused by indiscriminate and superficial use of collaborative activities were discussed. Finally, main issues were identified to be considered to perform the design of collaborative activities, such as those relating to the formation of groups, selection, clarity, flexibility and significance of the task, and monitoring and control.

To achieve positive interdependence among students, just putting them in group and telling them to work together may not be sufficient. Previously, several types of positive interdependencies have been identified for unsupported group activities. These kinds of interdependencies are now instantiated for the case of computer-supported group learning. The examples we show in this paper are taken from computer games and other tools we have developed to set students in a scenario in which they must collaborate in order to succeed. This paper also presents diverse forms of structuring positive interdependence in software tools based on the interface design to ensure that students think we instead of me.},

abstract = {Many universities choose the C programming language (C) as the first one they teach their students, early on in their program. However, students often consider programming courses difficult, and these courses often have among the highest dropout rates of computer science courses offered. It is therefore critical to provide more effective instruction to help students understand the syntax of C and prevent them losing interest in programming. In addition, homework and paper-based exams are still the main assessment methods in the majority of classrooms. It is difficult for teachers to grasp students' learning situation due to the large amount of evaluation work. To facilitate teaching and learning of C, in this article we propose a system—LAPLE (Learning Analytics in Programming Language Education)—that provides a learning dashboard to capture the behavior of students in the classroom and identify the different difficulties faced by different students looking at different knowledge. With LAPLE, teachers may better grasp students' learning situation in real time and better improve educational materials using analysis results. For their part, novice undergraduate programmers may use LAPLE to locate syntax errors in C and get recommendations from educational materials on how to fix them.},

abstract = {Computer science education, CS1, Bayesian networks Researchers have long tried to identify factors that could explain why programming is easier for some than the others or that can be used to predict programming performance. The motivation behind most studies has been identifying students who are at risk to fail and improving passing rates on introductory courses as these have a direct impact on retention rates. Various potential factors have been identified, and these include factors related to students' background, programming behavior or psychological and cognitive characteristics. However, the results have been inconsistent. This thesis replicates some of these previous studies in a new context, and pairwise analyses of various factors and performance are performed. We have data collected from 3 different cohorts of an introductory Java programming course that contains a large number of exercises and where personal assistance is available. In addition, this thesis contributes to the topic by modeling the dependencies between several of these factors. This is done by learning a Bayesian network from the data. We will then evaluate these networks by trying to predict whether students will pass or fail the course. The focus is on factors related to students' background and psychological and cognitive characteristics. No clear predictors were identified in this study. We were able to find weak correlations between some of the factors and programming performance. However, in general, the correlations we found were smaller than in previous studies or nonexistent. In addition, finding just one optimal network that describes the domain is not straightforward , and the classification rates obtained were poor. Thus, the results suggest that factors related to students' background and psychological and cognitive characteristics that were included in this study are not good predictors of programming performance in our context.},

abstract = {Picking up from a previous publication in IJLE, the primary objective of this article is to engage in a critical analysis of the concept and practice of 'active' (including 'participatory') learning as well as the usefulness to educators of 'active learning methodologies'. Through a review of relevant literature and research, highlighting problems in theory, and an analysis of examples of active learning in practice, the article addresses a number of issues raised by previous attempts to promote active learning. It argues, in conclusion, that while promoting active learning is generally a good thing, the success of an active learning methodology depends not on methodology alone but, ultimately, on the constantly-evolving, dialectical relationship between methodology and learners, mediated by the educator. Practical implications are that educators need not be over-obsessed about questions of methodology, though it is important to experiment with new methods and make them a constant focus of discussion between educators and learners; further research could focus on the extent to which (and under what circumstances) educators and/or learners might change (or already have changed) their perceptions about different ways of teaching and learning.},

abstract = {With the aim of characterizing self-regulated learning of engineering students in a Colombian university, students were asked to answer a Spanish version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ); this questionnaire enables obtaining information on epistemic motivation and learning strategies of the students in the courses they are studying. The data found suggest the dimensional structure of the questionnaire did not meet the context of those students. It was decided to make a new translation of the MSLQ into Spanish and make linguistic and cultural adaptations in order to achieve a valid instrument; this work began with the International Test Commission (ITC) guidelines. As a result, a new questionnaire was attained, MSLQ-Colombia. The objective of this article is to present the method used to obtain the MSLQ-Colombia, and the study of the psychometric properties of the new questionnaire. The psychometric properties studied were the construct validity, content validity and reliability. These properties were determined by factor analysis, Cronbach's Alpha and experts consultation. The participants of this research were 1218 engineering students and 12 university teachers. The results indicate the new questionnaire is valid and reliable, provide information to those who may use MSLQ-Colombia to comprehend the results of their investigations, and offer the international community new empirical evidences on MSLQ psychometric properties. It led to the conclusion that the MSLQ-Colombia has similar psychometric properties to the original MSLQ in English, and that the new questionnaire can be useful for the Spanish speaking international community. This article can be a valuable guide for those researchers, who desire making translations-adaptations of the MSLQ into languages-cultures different from English or Spanish, and also, to translate-adapt questionnaires of self-report besides the MSLQ.},

abstract = {METAMODELOS (Entendemos por "Metamodelos" cada una de las distintas clases de " modelos de situaciones problem{\'{a}}ticas " , presentadas a la actividad del alumno, capaces de generar ideas v{\'{a}}lidas para la invenci{\'{o}}n, reconstrucci{\'{o}}n y resoluci{\'{o}}n de problemas matem{\'{a}}ticos). -GENERATIVOS. Deben ser las primeras situaciones a las que se enfrente el alumno, aunque no tienen que ocupar {\'{u}}nicamente esos primeros lugares. Desarrollan la confianza y seguridad de los alumnos en s{\'{i}} mismos. Ayudan a generar ideas y a utilizar el razonamiento l{\'{o}}gico. La operaci{\'{o}}n queda subordinada al pensamiento, del que se desprende divergencia y flexibilidad. Ayudan a percibir la estrategia como v{\'{i}}a de soluci{\'{o}}n y a buscar, a posteriori, la operaci{\'{o}}n v{\'{a}}lida para dar cuerpo al proceso de resoluci{\'{o}}n. El n{\'{u}}mero es algo secundario. Permiten retener el desaf{\'{i}}o central a partir del cual se reflexiona. Se percibe la importancia de la ausencia de arbitrariedad en los problemas. Se desarrolla la atenci{\'{o}}n, la actitud cr{\'{i}}tica, la capacidad de tolerancia, colaboraci{\'{o}}n y solidaridad respecto a las ideas de los dem{\'{a}}s. -De ESTRUCTURACI{\'{O}}N. Ayudan a estructurar mentalmente las partes que componen el problema: Enunciado, pregunta, resoluci{\'{o}}n, soluci{\'{o}}n. Se percibe la importancia de cada una, la relaci{\'{o}}n que tienen y la no-arbitrariedad entre ellas. Al implicar al alumno en la construcci{\'{o}}n del problema interpreta mentalmente la situaci{\'{o}}n problem{\'{a}}tica, utilizando las operaciones matem{\'{a}}ticas como instrumentos para la resoluci{\'{o}}n de las estrategias elegidas; distingue la soluci{\'{o}}n del problema de la resoluci{\'{o}}n de {\'{e}}ste y es capaz de estimar con razonamiento l{\'{o}}gico la validez del resultado debido a que ha utilizado la reversibilidad de los procesos operativos como t{\'{e}}cnica de verificaci{\'{o}}n. Se es consciente de que un mismo resultado se puede corresponder con diferentes situaciones planteadas; donde un alumno suma, otro resta. Del mismo modo se es consciente de que una misma operaci{\'{o}}n o conjunto de operaciones da lugar a la creaci{\'{o}}n de una amplia diversidad de situaciones. Se observan interesantes razones para respetar las ideas de los dem{\'{a}}s. -ENLACES. Ayudan a encontrar la concordancia l{\'{o}}gica entre enunciado-pregunta-soluci{\'{o}}n; se trabaja con variables de relaci{\'{o}}n entre estas partes: variables sint{\'{a}}cticas, l{\'{o}}gicas, matem{\'{a}}ticas, creencias sociales, experiencias propias. Desarrollan la atenci{\'{o}}n y la prudencia en el trabajo. Evitan la dependencia de la asociaci{\'{o}}n de formas ling{\"{u}}{\'{i}}sticas con la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de operaciones. No interviene el azar en la utilizaci{\'{o}}n de los datos; se percibe el significado de {\'{e}}stos dentro de la situaci{\'{o}}n problem{\'{a}}tica. Se comprende que no todos los problemas presentan datos num{\'{e}}ricos y que no todos los datos de un problema son num{\'{e}}ricos.},

Our specific interest was to explore the students' experiences with the univer-sity level course. Our analyses indicate that immediate and regular support was highly important for student perfor-mance, as support of this kind could mitigate issues related to students' orientation towards the high workload of the course. Students who showed academic interest were likely to pass, whereas students lacking self-direction or work effi-ciency were likely to drop out. Both passed and drop-outs found the course to be a good learning experience. The game theme of the course was in most cases found highly motivat-ing and fun, while it was not a necessity for the majority of the students. This information can be utilized by higher ed-ucation instructors who plan to carry out university courses in cooperation with high schools.},

Muitos deles est{\~{a}}o relacionados {\`{a}} programa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o de aprendizado, mas tamb{\'{e}}m existem outros fatores importantes. Por exemplo, as prefer{\^{e}}ncias dos alunos em seus estudos, o estudo geral da motiva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o, a isola{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o dos colegas e as habilidades de estudo ruins t{\^{e}}m seu papel aqui. - Abandonar o curso {\'{e}} a realiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o final de v{\'{a}}rias dificuldades que um aluno enfrenta ao estudar. com tais informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es, no entanto, os professores n{\~{a}}o re{\'{u}}nem informa{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es sistematicamente e, na maioria das vezes, v{\^{e}}em apenas o topo dos problemas. - Em cursos t{\~{a}}o grandes, {\'{e}} extremamente raro que um professor acompanhe cuidadosamente o progresso de um {\'{u}}nico aluno durante todo o curso. Al{\'{e}}m do mais, os professores naturalmente se concentram em problemas relacionados ao aprendizado do assunto e podem negligenciar outros fatores envolvidos. - Portanto, suas a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es para melhorar o curso podem ser ineficazes, se abordarem apenas uma parte dos problemas e obst{\'{a}}culos que os alunos enfrentam no curso. - Para projetar a{\c{c}}{\~{o}}es eficientes, precisamos de uma boa figura geral do campo do problema. Nesta pesquisa, pretendemos esclarecer e descrever a variedade de raz{\~{o}}es de abandono entre os menores de CS no HUT. - Para conseguir isso, escolhemos uma abordagem em duas fases. - Primeiro, um question{\'{a}}rio foi submetido aos alunos, que abandonaram o curso no semestre de primavera de 2005. No question{\'{a}}rio, perguntamos sobre suas opini{\~{o}}es sobre o curso e as raz{\~{o}}es por tr{\'{a}}s de sua decis{\~{a}}o de abandonar o curso. - Em segundo lugar, essa informa{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o foi usada para projetar uma entrevista para um n{\'{u}}mero menor de alunos, onde quer{\'{i}}amos nos aprofundar nas verdadeiras raz{\~{o}}es para abandonar o curso. Nossa abordagem foi qualitativa, porque o objetivo principal era obter uma melhor compreens{\~{a}}o dos fatores envolvidos na queda do curso. - Mais tarde, pretendemos continuar a pesquisa, mapeando o significado de cada fator usando m{\'{e}}todos estat{\'{i}}sticos. - O entrevistador era um pesquisador que n{\~{a}}o tinha nada a ver com a organiza{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o do curso. - Todos os resultados foram processados ​​de forma an{\^{o}}nima. Assim, os estudantes entrevistados estavam livres para apresentar seus pensamentos e sentimentos sobre o curso sem temer que suas opini{\~{o}}es pudessem afetar seus futuros estudos.},

@inproceedings{Nuutila2008,
abstract = {. We describe an implementation of an introductory programming course using the seven steps method of problem-based learning (PBL). In that method students working in small groups learn programming by trying to make sense of complex real-world problems, so-called cases. We outline the organization of the course and give examples of possible cases. We then describe our experiences with the role of tutoring in the method and the properties of programming-related PBL cases. We carried out experiments with tutorless PBL to see if the method could scale up to courses with large numbers of students. The results were disappointing. Student questionnairies reveal possible reasons. Firstly, when a tutor is not present, the students become insecure if they are progressing in a fruitful direction and thus come frustrated and lose motivation. Secondly, the behaviour of a group may deteriorate, i.e., become unbalanced or turn into irrelevant chatting. We have also analyzed the properties of our PBL cases, since it is not straightforward to identify good PBL cases in the area of programming. In the analysis we try to spell out what the concept open-ended real-world problem means and how it is affected if the focus of work is on explanation or design. We relate the cases to different aspects of programming skills and present student feedback on the cases. 1.},

However, less is known about the ways in which pair programming can unintentionally lead to inequitable relationships between students. Audio data were collected from pair programming interactions in a sixth-grade computer science enrichment program designed to promote equity. However, even in this context, there were surprising instances of inequity. We measured inequity by documenting the distribution of students' questions, commands, and total talk within four pairs. Analysis revealed that less equitable pairs sought to complete tasks quickly and this may have led to patterns of marginalization and domination. Notably, this focus on speed was not evident in the more equitable pairs. These findings are important for understanding mechanisms of inequity and designing equitable collaboration practices in computer science.},

abstract = {In recent years software has become integral part of our lives. From product software has become a service now. Software industry has undergone a shift in paradigm. Companies look into every aspect for effective project management. Practitioners have started considering human aspect equally important in the product, process, people triad. Human aspect has become top concern for companies' management since companies have realized that software is a product which is completely people driven. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the data mining area, where the objective is the discovery of knowledge that is correct and of high benefit for management. In this paper, we propose a model for high capability performance . This approach has proven to have positive impact on software development. It is a experimental and empirically driven model that builds a project team capability to achieve the desired software quality within the time and cost constraints. It is integration of personnel capability and post training. The capability and training are co-supportive and work in conjunction to ensure project success.},

abstract = {As an important coordination and cooperation mechanism in multi-agent systems, coalition of agents exhibits some excellent characteristics and draws researchers' attention increasingly. Cooperation formation has been a very active area of research in multi-agent systems. An efficient algorithm is needed for this topic since the numbers of the possible coalitions are exponential in the number of agents. Genetic algorithm (GA) has been widely reckoned as a useful tool for obtaining high quality and optimal solutions for a broad range of combinatorial optimization problems due to its intelligent advantages of self-organization, self-adaptation and inherent parallelism. This paper proposes a GA-based algorithm for coalition structure formation which aims at achieving goals of high performance, scalability, and fast convergence rate simultaneously. A novel 2D binary chromosome encoding approach and corresponding crossover and mutation operators are presented in this paper. Two valid parental chromosomes are certain to produce a valid offspring under the operation of the crossover operator. This improves the efficiency and shortens the running time greatly. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through a robust comparison with heuristic search algorithms. We have confirmed that our new algorithm is robust, self-adaptive and very efficient by experiments. The results of the proposed algorithm are found to be satisfactory.},

@article{Asproth2011,
abstract = {This paper starts with a presentation of experiences from a joint project where courses in infor- matics have been developed together with industry partners. The industry partners were of vari- ous size. Some of them were producers of for example cars and aero planes and also making Technical documentation for their products, while other companies were subcontractors for the Technical Communication. A problem that occurs in the Technical Communication sector is that companies have big problems to find and employ staff with a suitable competence. Therefore the project aimed to analyze the need for competence development within organizations dealing with Technical Communication, in order to develop suitable courses for students to obtain employabil- ity. A model for course development based on Triple loop learning has been developed and is presented. The steps in the model are: State of the art within the area of Technical Communica- tion; Identification of requirements and quality requirement for Technical Communication; Iden- tification of need of competencies; Identification of existing courses and training; Course Devel- opment; Realization of courses; Evaluation of courses and effects of the courses; Further devel- opment of courses. The first step and part of step two was conducted as a literature study, while the other part of step two and step three was accomplished with help of interviews with different stakeholders. The course development and the realization of the courses were carried through to- gether with the industry partners in the project. When it comes to co-operation between academia and industry everyone is convinced that it is a good thing. Our experience is also that there is much benefit in collaboration. However the ways of communication have to be considered. Balancing differences between different companies needs and balancing differences between the academic requirements on higher education and in- dustry partners desires regarding the courses have to be considered. A conclusion from the project is that it is difficult to in one hand catch all needs and requirements from the stakeholders from different levels in the companies and on the other hand get a balance between different stakeholders interests.

abstract = {In large-scale natural disasters, humans are likely to fail when they attempt to reach high-risk sites or act in search and rescue operations. Robots, however, outdo their counterparts in surviving the hazards and handling the search and rescue missions due to their multiple and diverse sensing and actuation capabilities. The dynamic formation of optimal coalition of these heterogeneous robots for cost efficiency is very challenging and research in the area is gaining more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic. Since the population of robots in large-scale disaster settings is very large, we rely on Quantum Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (QMOPSO). The problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. Simulations with different test cases and metrics, and comparison with other algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA-II are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms not only in terms of convergence but also in terms of diversity and processing time.},

abstract = {Motivation is a very important factor for successful instruction. This factor is especially relevant in collaborative learning contexts, where social interaction plays an important role. In this paper we present an evaluation of motivation in 139 students who were instructed under four pedagogical approaches: traditional lecture, collaborative learning, collaborative learning guided by CIF (an instructional framework for collaborative learning), and collaborative learning guided by CIF and supported by MoCAS (a collaborative learning tool). We considered the four dimensions of motivation according to self-determination theory. The statistical results show that, in global terms, students were more motivated by jointly using the collaborative instructional approach CIF and the MoCAS tool than by using a collaborative approach. Detailed analysis of the different kinds of motivation yields mixed results. Students who were instructed with CIF and especially those students instructed with CIF and MoCAS exhibited higher intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students instructed with CIF and MoCAS were the most extrinsically motivated via identified regulation. With respect to extrinsic motivation via external regulation, students instructed in a traditional, individual way were more motivated than students instructed collaboratively. Finally, high levels of amotivation were also associated to instruction using CIF and MoCAS. In summary, our results suggest that CIF and MoCAS are associated with high levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a finding that can aid in improving the learning processes, but they are also, unexpectedly, associated with amotivation, suggesting an overall increase in activation in the students who show mixed motivators. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Wikis today are being used as a tool to conduct collaborative writing assignments in classrooms. However, typical Wikis do not adequately address the assessment of individual student contributions toward their groups or provide any automated group formation mechanism. To improve these aspects, we have designed and implemented ClassroomWiki - a web-based collaborative Wiki writing tool. For the students, ClassroomWiki provides a web interface for writing and revising their group's Wiki and a topic-based forum for discussing their ideas during collaboration. When the students collaborate, ClassroomWiki tracks all student activities and builds detailed student models that represent their contributions toward their groups. For the teacher, ClassroomWiki provides a multiagent framework that uses the student models to form student groups to improve the collaborative learning of students. To investigate the impact of ClassroomWiki, we have conducted a three-week-long collaborative Wiki writing assignment in a university-level history course. The results suggest that ClassroomWiki can 1) improve the collaborative learning outcome of the students by its group formation framework, 2) help the teacher better assess a student's contribution toward his or her group and avoid free riding, and 3) facilitate specific and precise teacher intervention with accurate and detailed tracking of student activities.},

abstract = {This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice.},

abstract = {Educational psychology findings indicate that active processing (such as self-testing) is more effective for learning than passive reading or even rereading. Electronic books (ebooks) can include much more than static pictures and text. Ebooks can promote better learning by increasing the reader's interaction with the material through multi-modal learning supports, worked examples, and low cognitive load practice activities. For example, multiple choice questions with immediate feedback can help identify misconceptions and gaps in knowledge. Parsons problems, which are mixed up code segments that have to be put in the correct order, require learners to think about the order of the statements in a solution without having to worry about syntax errors. Our research group has been applying concepts from educational psychology to make learning from ebooks more effective and efficient. This paper reports on an observational study and log file analysis on the use of an ebook that incorporates interactive activities. We provide evidence that learners engaged in the interactive activities, but used some types of activities more than others. We also found evidence that learners encountered some "desirable difficulties" which can improve learning. This descriptive study informs a research agenda to improve the quality of instruction in computing education.},

A quantitative analysis of logs showed that most students, and beginners especially, used the PVs, even where the PV did not directly affect their grade. Students commonly spent more time studying certain steps than others, suggesting they used the PVs attentively. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of students appeared to gloss over some key animation steps, something that future improvements to pedagogy may address. Overall, the results suggest that integrating PVs into an ebook can promote student engagement and has been fairly successful in the studied context.

The impressions students take away from these courses are crucial, setting the tone for the rest of the students' computer science education. It is known that students struggle with many concepts central to computer science, struggles that could be alleviated in part through hands-on practice and individualized instruction. However, even the best existing instructional practices do not facilitate individualized hands-on support for students at large. We have built JavaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory computer science, which works alongside students to support them through both cognitive (skills and knowledge) and affective (emotion-based) feedback. JavaTutor aims to make advances in interactive, scalable student support. JavaTutor's behaviors were developed within a novel framework that leverages machine learning to acquire tutorial strategies from data collected within tutorial sessions between novice students and experienced human tutors. This demo presents an overview of the data-driven development of JavaTutor and shows how JavaTutor assesses and responds to students' contextualized needs. It is hoped that JavaTutor will help to usher in a new generation of tutorial systems for computer science education that adapt to individual students based not only on incoming student knowledge, but on a broad range of other student characteristics.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Software process improvement (SPI) has been around for decades: frameworks are proposed, success factors are studied, and experiences have been reported. However, the sheer mass of concepts, approaches, and standards published over the years overwhelms practitioners as well as researchers. What is out there? Are there new trends and emerging approaches? What are open issues? Still, we struggle to answer these questions about the current state of SPI and related research. In this article, we present results from an updated systematic mapping study to shed light on the field of SPI, to develop a big picture of the state of the art, and to draw conclusions for future research directions. An analysis of 769 publications draws a big picture of SPI-related research of the past quarter-century. Our study shows a high number of solution proposals, experience reports, and secondary studies, but only few theories and models on SPI in general. In particular, standard SPI models like CMMI and ISO/IEC 15,504 are analyzed, enhanced, and evaluated for applicability in practice, but these standards are also critically discussed, e.g., from the perspective of SPI in small-to-medium-sized companies, which leads to new specialized frameworks. New and specialized frameworks account for the majority of the contributions found (approx. 38{\%}). Furthermore, we find a growing interest in success factors (approx. 16{\%}) to aid companies in conducting SPI and in adapting agile principles and practices for SPI (approx. 10{\%}). Beyond these specific topics, the study results also show an increasing interest into secondary studies with the purpose of aggregating and structuring SPI-related knowledge. Finally, the present study helps directing future research by identifying under-researched topics awaiting further investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Galaxy Project offers the popular web browser-based platform Galaxy for running bioinformatics tools and constructing simple workflows. Here, we present a broad collection of additional Galaxy tools for large scale analysis of gene and protein sequences. The motivating research theme is the identification of specific genes of interest in a range of non-model organisms, and our central example is the identification and prediction of "effector" proteins produced by plant pathogens in order to manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a pathogen's predicted capacity for virulence is a key step in translating sequence data into potential applications in plant pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within Galaxy. Individual bioinformatics software tools are typically available separately as standalone packages, or in online browser-based form. The Galaxy framework enables the user to combine these and other tools to automate organism scale analyses as workflows, without demanding familiarity with command line tools and scripting. Workflows created using Galaxy can be saved and are reusable, so may be distributed within and between research groups, facilitating the construction of a set of standardised, reusable bioinformatic protocols. The Galaxy tools and workflows described in this manuscript are open source and freely available from the Galaxy Tool Shed (http://usegalaxy.org/toolshed or http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu).},

abstract = {Characterizing transcriptomes in non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary, and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. The Oyster River Protocol (ORP), described here, implements a standardized and benchmarked set of bioinformatic processes, resulting in an assembly with enhanced qualities over other standard assembly methods. Specifically, ORP produced assemblies have higher Detonate and TransRate scores and mapping rates, which is largely a product of the fact that it leverages a multi-assembler and kmer assembly process, thereby bypassing the shortcomings of any one approach. These improvements are important, as previously unassembled transcripts are included in ORP assemblies, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power of downstream analysis. Further, as part of this study, I show that assembly quality is unrelated with the number of reads generated, above 30 million reads.

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, decreases grain yield and quality in wheat and barley. Disease severity, deoxynivalenol (DON), fungal biomass, and transcript accumulation were examined in a wheat near-isogenic line pair carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele for the chromosome 3BS FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (Fhb1). Fhb1 restricts spread of disease symptoms but does not provide resistance to initial infection or initial DON accumulation. Wheat exhibits both induction and repression of large sets of gene transcripts during F. graminearum infection. In addition, a difference in the general timing of transcript accumulation in plants carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele at the Fhb1 locus was detected, and 14 wheat gene transcripts were detected that exhibited accumulation differences between the resistant and susceptible alleles. These results indicate that these may be host responses that differentiate the resistant from the susceptible interaction. Comparative analysis of the wheat-F. graminearum and the barley-F. graminearum interactions revealed a large set of conserved transcript accumulation patterns. However, we also detected gene transcripts that were repressed in wheat but not in barley. Based on the disease symptoms, transcript accumulation data, and comparative analysis of the barley and wheat host response to F. graminearum infection, we developed an integrated model for the interactions of wheat and barley with F. graminearum.},

Companies look into every aspect for effective project management. Practitioners have started considering human aspect equally important in the product, process, people triad. Human aspect has become top concern for companies' management since companies have realized that software is a product which is completely people driven. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the data mining area, where the objective is the discovery of knowledge that is correct and of high benefit for management. In this paper, we propose a model for high capability performance . This approach has proven to have positive impact on software development. It is a experimental and empirically driven model that builds a project team capability to achieve the desired software quality within the time and cost constraints. It is integration of personnel capability and post training. The capability and training are co-supportive and work in conjunction to ensure project success.},

The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field. {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly dependent on third-party libraries. It is widely recognized that using mature and well-tested third-party libraries can improve developers' productivity, reduce time-to-market, and produce more reliable software. Today's open-source repositories provide a wide range of libraries that can be freely downloaded and used. However, as software libraries are documented separately but intended to be used together, developers are unlikely to fully take advantage of these reuse opportunities. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically identify third-party library usage patterns, i.e., collections of libraries that are commonly used together by developers. Our approach employs a hierarchical clustering technique to group together software libraries based on external client usage. To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6000 popular libraries from Maven Central Repository and investigated their usage by over 38,000 client systems from the Github repository. Our experiments show that our technique is able to detect the majority (77{\%}) of highly consistent and cohesive library usage patterns across a considerable number of client systems.},

However, most studies have concentrated on intra-group studies. We believe that computer supported collaborative learning tools can also aid software engineering students to have beneficial inter-group collaboration. In this research the communication patterns in three collaborative software engineering courses were analyzed with the method of social network analysis. It was found out that students do collaborate, but mostly along pre-established social connections. The main reason for this was the difficulty in matchmaking and discovering others who were struggling with the same problems. Our proposal is to study how students in similar learning scenarios benefit from computer supported collaborative tools that increase networking opportunities. The findings presented in this paper provide a baseline for comparison when performing social network analysis in future studies.},

abstract = {Motivation is a very important factor for successful instruction. This factor is especially relevant in collaborative learning contexts, where social interaction plays an important role. In this paper we present an evaluation of motivation in 139 students who were instructed under four pedagogical approaches: traditional lecture, collaborative learning, collaborative learning guided by CIF (an instructional framework for collaborative learning), and collaborative learning guided by CIF and supported by MoCAS (a collaborative learning tool). We considered the four dimensions of motivation according to self-determination theory. The statistical results show that, in global terms, students were more motivated by jointly using the collaborative instructional approach CIF and the MoCAS tool than by using a collaborative approach. Detailed analysis of the different kinds of motivation yields mixed results. Students who were instructed with CIF and especially those students instructed with CIF and MoCAS exhibited higher intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students instructed with CIF and MoCAS were the most extrinsically motivated via identified regulation. With respect to extrinsic motivation via external regulation, students instructed in a traditional, individual way were more motivated than students instructed collaboratively. Finally, high levels of amotivation were also associated to instruction using CIF and MoCAS. In summary, our results suggest that CIF and MoCAS are associated with high levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a finding that can aid in improving the learning processes, but they are also, unexpectedly, associated with amotivation, suggesting an overall increase in activation in the students who show mixed motivators.},

Abstract In computer-supported collaborative learning contexts, group formation is a key aspect, since different characteristics of students might influence the group performance. In this article, we present an intelligent assistant that models group formation as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP). The assistant takes into account three students' features, namely: psychological styles, team roles and social networks. The proposed WCSP approach is able to combine constraints and preferences both for individuals and groups. The main goal of the assistant is to aid teachers to form learning groups considering factors such as team role balance and distribution of psychological styles. We also describe a pilot study to evaluate our proposal in different scenarios.},

In Turkey between 2003 and 2005 at 10 centers 64 cardiac transplantations were performed including five at our facility. Herein we have presented our results. All patients were men of mean age 34.2 +/- 10.7 (17 to 44) years. Upon preoperative echocardiography their mean ejection fraction was 18{\%} +/- 3.27{\%} (17{\%} to 23{\%}). Pulmonary vascular resistance was 4.47 wood unit in one patient and in one case, there was Rh incompatibility between donor and recipient. We used HTK solution for protection of donor hearts. Mean ischemia time was 251.2 +/- 62.7 minutes (155 to 314). Mean aortic clamping time was 84 +/- 4.7 minutes (80 to 90). In all patients we performed a biatrial anastomosis technique. Hemofiltration was used to prevent hemodilution during operation. In the postoperative period four patients had acute renal dysfunction; one, a minor cerebrovascular accident; two, reoperated because of bleeding; one, cholestasis; one, temporary atrio-ventricular block; and one, mediastinitis. Mean follow-up time was 15.6 +/- 19.7 months (2 to 50). Neither early nor late mortality has occurred. All patients are in New York Heart Association class I. In all cases we used triple immunosuppressive therapy. In the follow-up period the mean number of cardiac biopsies per patient was 4.2 +/- 3.03 (2 to 8). Two cases had cardiac catheterization. As a complication of cardiac biopsy, pericardial tamponade developed in one patient; in another one we observed a right ventricular aneursym after cardiac biopsy. Cardiac transplantation was performed with low mortality and morbidity rates in end-stage cardiac failure patients with longer life expectancy and higher life quality. Unfortunately in our country, because of difficulties to find donor hearts, cardiac transplantations were small in number. For better results, we need a larger series.},

In this paper, we investigate how student motivated engagement profiles developed in educational research can be used as such models to predict student behaviors. These models are advanta-geous over those learned directly from observing individual stu-dents, as they rely on different data that can be available a priori before students use the technology. Using tracked behaviors of 249 students from 7 CS1 courses over the span of 3 semesters, we discover that students with different engagement profiles indeed behave differently in an online, wiki-based CSCL system while performing collaborative creative thinking exercises, and the dif-ferences between students are primarily as expected based on the differences in the profiles. Thus, such profiles could be useful as student models for providing customized support in e-learning environments in CS1 courses.},

The system also incorporates multiagent coalition formation algorithms for forming peer groups. I-MINDS also provides a group agent for each peer group that monitors and evaluates its assigned peer group. I-MINDS has been deployed and evaluated in an introductory computer science course (CS1). Results show that intelligent tools such as I-MINDS can be used in a real-time environment to support student cooperative learning activities, and also as a testbed to collect instructional or pedagogical data for better understanding of student collaborative learning. This paper describes the I-MINDS framework, implementation, deployment, and test results comprehensively.},

abstract = {In this paper we describe computer-supported structured cooperative learning, applied to the laboratories of an introductory CS1 course. We extended I-MINDS, a multiagent system that supports student-teacher and student-student real-time interactions, to support a cooperative learning paradigm called Jigsaw. Jigsaw considers of several phases of activities, including dividing students into different groups for focused exploration, reporting and reshaping, and integration and evaluation. I-MINDS supports the formation of teams and monitors the interaction. We have deployed I-MINDS in the hands-on programming laboratories in CS1, comparing student performance in the lab using only Jigsaw (where students carried out the Jigsaw process with face-to-face interactions) and in the lab using I-MINDS supported Jigsaw (where students could interact only through I-MINDS). We report the results of our study on the design of I-MINDS to support Jigsaw and the impact of I-MINDS in student performance.},

@article{Khandaker2011,
abstract = {Recent years have seen a surge in the use of intelligent computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) tools for improving student learning in traditional classrooms. However, adopting such a CSCL tool in a classroom still requires the teacher to develop (or decide on which to adopt) the CSCL tool and the CSCL script, design the relevant pedagogical aspects (i.e., the learning objectives, assessment method, etc.) to overcome the associated challenges (e.g., free riding, student assessment, forming student groups that improve student learning, etc). We have used a multiagent-based system to develop a CSCL application and multiagent-frameworks to form student groups that improve student collaborative learning. In this paper, we describe the contexts of our three generations of CSCL applications (i.e., I-MINDS and ClassroomWiki) and provide a set of lessons learned from our deployments in terms of the script, tool, and pedagogical aspects of using CSCL. We believe that our lessons would allow 1) the instructors and students to use intelligent CSCL applications more effectively and efficiently, and help to improve the design of such systems, and 2) the researchers to gain additional insights into the impact of collaborative learning theories when they are applied to real-world classrooms.},

abstract = {Traditional computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) systems focus primarily on facilitating group work amongst students, providing several different modes for different types of communication, from chatting applications to shared whiteboards. The power of a good CSCL system, in addition to the interactions it supports, lies with the data the system can gather from those interactions (both relational and content-based). Thus, we have developed the Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed System in Education (I-MINDS), a CSCL system built on the Microsoft ConferenceXP platform that tracks real-time data to support student learning and classroom management. I-MINDS facilitates (1) student-student interactions through message dialogs, stored as trees, and (2) student-teacher interactions through question/answer pairs. I-MINDS logs these interactions in a MySQL database. Our VirtualClass room analysis tool derives statistics from these interactions such as student responsiveness, degree of dialog involvement, amount of contribution, and quality of involvement and contribution. Then, an instructor can view overall,trends for individual students and groups and detailed charts for all statistics for each student or all students for each statistic, which is especially helpful in large classrooms and in distance education. The instructor can also adjust a "highlight" threshold for each statistic such that any value failing to meet the threshold will be highlighted for easy observation. Our DatabaseSearch analysis tool allows students and teachers to search through recorded interactions and filter the results based on metadata such as time interval, class relevance, or keyword content.},

It is widely used to model the different actors of E-learning systems and manage their interactions, to meet their dynamic and execution needs by their innovative features like intelligence and autonomy. In education field, multi-agent systems makes a great change in the society in the fact that the conventional education system requires the presence of both student and instructor at same place, the same time and at the same interval of time. This kind of system equips with these characters; and provides many advantages like autonomy, reactivity, social ability and proactivity. There are several collaborative E-learning environments using multi-agent technologies that included I-MIND, MASCE, ALLEGRO, etc. Our work aims to define the importance of a collaborative learning system, to define the roles of each actor and the different possible communications between them, to determine the tasks of the agents that can be automated. Furthermore, an analysis of existing multi-agent based collaborative E-learning systems on the basis of their various features covering collaboration features, studenttutor interaction, adaptability measurement and security in order to identify your strengths and weaknesses to determine the most suitable model to our system.},

The focus is threefold: 1) analyze critical design issues of AICLS systems and organize them under a unifying classification scheme, 2) present research evidence on the impact of these systems on student learning, and 3) identify current trends and open research questions in the field. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 105 articles were included in the review with 70 of them reporting concrete evaluation data on the learning impact of AICLS systems. Systems design analysis led us to propose a classification scheme with five dimensions: pedagogical objective, target of adaptation, modeling, technology, and design space. The reviewed articles indicate that AICLS systems increasingly introduce Artificial Intelligence and Web 2.0 techniques to support pretask interventions, in-task peer interactions, and learning domain-specific activities. Findings also suggest that AICLS systems may improve both learners' domain knowledge and collaboration skills. However, these benefits are subject to the learning design and the capability of AICLS to adapt and intervene in an unobtrusive way. Finally, providing peer interaction support seems to motivate students and improve collaboration and learning},

The research addressed questions in CSCL including-among others - how groups and individuals learn through peer interaction using specific tools, how small groups interact and develop shared meanings over time, how teachers orchestrate collaborative learning activities in the classroom with the support of technology, how institutions change and create new conditions for teaching and learning, and even how the opportunities for learning change as society adopts new models for education. Following the constructivistic and socio-cultural approaches in learning, numerous CSCL tools have been designed, developed and tested over the years. Although they can be classified in various ways, the distinction between systemic and dialogic types of tools and approaches is adopted in this paper. Following this categorization, four interesting research approaches, each focusing on a different kind of computer mediated tool are presented, designating the diversity of research within the CSCL field.

abstract = {Costs and benefits are recurrent issues that concern all the computing areas, including computer and software engineering. Mastery of optimization algorithms is essential in these fields, but their didactics hardly has received any attention. To fill this gap, the interactive system GreedEx was designed to support the active learning of greedy algorithms by means of experimentation. In this article we describe GreedExCol, a collaborative extension of GreedEx that complements its experimental phase with a discussion phase held by the students in each team. The contributions of the article are threefold. Firstly, we present GreedExCol, a CSCL system aimed at supporting collaborative discussion on experimental results of optimality for greedy algorithms. Secondly, GreedExCol was evaluated with respect to educational effectiveness, obtaining statistically significant improvements of the collaborative, experimental approach over an individual, experimental approach without the support of GreedExCol. Thirdly, GreedExCol was evaluated in the same two groups with respect to motivation, obtaining a statistically significant increase of implicit motivation for students in the experimental group. Overall, we present a medium-term effort for developing an innovative learning system and a comprehensive evaluation of its impact over the students. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The problem of assigning learners to groups is essential in collaborative venture like group peer mentorship. Usually, in group peer mentorship, the group of peers is focused on one topic or question, and engage in discussion, argumentation, and providing criticism and constructive feedback, related to the individual contributions made by the participants. Therefore, the problem here is how to group peers that provide feedback to each other to ensure that all peers benefit from the venture, and everybody has something to offer. This problem is akin to the group formation problem in the area of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Many group formation algorithms exist in the area of CSCL, but they have problem with limited and fixed constraints, evaluation strategies, their initial grouping mechanism and the goal of the grouping strategy. Therefore, we proposed a grouping algorithm based on some constraints and the principles of the Hungarian algorithm, to achieve a diversified grouping of peers for every mentorship session. Although this algorithm had been used manually in some of our previous small scale studies, in this paper, we evaluated the algorithm using 1080 system generated data, and compared the performance of our algorithm with three other algorithms in CSCL. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract = {Social media technology has enabled virtual collaborative environments where people actively interact, share knowledge, coordinate activities, solve problems, co-create value, and innovate. Organizations have begun to leverage approaches and technologies to involve numerous people from outside their boundaries to perform organizational tasks. Despite the success and popularity of this 'crowdsourcing' phenomenon, there appears to be a distinct gap in the literature regarding the empirical evaluation of the factors involved in a crowdsourcing user experience. This paper aims to fill this void by proposing a theoretical model of the antecedents and their relationships for crowdsourcing user engagement. It is defined as the quality of effort online users devote to collaboration activities that contribute directly to desired outcomes. Drawing from research in psychology and IS, we identify three critical elements that precede crowdsourcing user engagement: personal interest in topic, goal clarity, and motivation to contribute. This paper examines the theoretical basis of these variables of interest in detail, derives a causal model of their interrelationships, and identifies future plans for model testing. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

They have been accused of sweeping up massive amounts of information without evidence of the technologies being effective in improving security. The view of critics is clear, but what do intelligence officials themselves say? This paper analyzes statements of intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K. from 2006 to 2016, examines what criteria officials use in their discourse on effectiveness, and investigates how considerations of cost and proportionality factor into the equation. It identifies seven measures of effectiveness in the statements of intelligence officials, and finds that cost, though rarely discussed, is the driver behind formalized evaluations of surveillance programs.},

abstract = {Motivation:While deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision and other fields, currently it does not work well on genomic data due to "big p, small n" problem (i.e., relatively small number of samples with high-dimensional features). In order to make deep learning work with a small amount of training data, we have to design new models that can facilitate few-shot learning. In this paper we focus on developing data efficient deep learning models that learn from a limited number of training examples and generalize well. Results: We developed two deep learningmodules: feature attention layer and k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) attention poolinglayer tomake ourmodelmuchmore data efficient than conventionaldeep learningmodels. Feature attention layer can directly select important features that are useful for patient classification. kNN attention pooling layer is based on graph attention model, and is good for semi-supervised few-shot learning. Experiments on both synthetic data and cancer genomic data from TCGA projects show that our method has better generalization power than conventional neural network model. Availability: We have implemented our method using PyTorch deep learning framework (https://pytorch.org). The code is freely available at https://github.com/BeautyOfWeb/AffinityNet.},

Abbreviated input is expanded into keywords by a Hidden Markov Model learned from a corpus of existing code. The technique does not require the user to memorize abbreviations and provides incremental feedback of the most likely completions. This paper presents the algorithm for abbreviation completion, integrated with a new user interface for multiple-keyword completion. We tested the system by sampling 3000 code lines from open source projects and found that more than 98{\%} of the code lines could be resolved from acronym-like abbreviations. A user study found 30{\%} reduction in time usage and 41{\%} reduction of keystrokes over conventional code completion. Code Completion; Hidden Ma},

Application performance requiring rapid real-time network provisioning, optimized traffic management, and virtualization of shared resources has induced the conceptualization and adoption of new networking models. Software defined networking (SDN), one of the predominant and relatively new networking paradigms, seeks to simplify network management by decoupling network control logic from the underlying hardware and introduces real-time network programmability enabling innovation. The present work reviews the state of the art in software defined networking providing a historical perspective on complementary technologies in network programmability and the inherent shortcomings which paved the way for SDN. The SDN architecture is discussed along with popular protocols, platforms, and existing simulation and debugging solutions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented around recent SDN development and deployment avenues ranging from mobile communications and data centers to campus networks and residential environments. The review concludes by highlighting implementation challenges and subsequent research directions being pursued in academia and industry to address issues related to application performance, control plane scalability and design, security, and interdomain connectivity in the context of SDN.},

abstract = {Problem-solving tasks are classified on the basis of four task characteristics (ambiguity, number of solutions, complexity, and experience), three process categories (preparation, production, and evaluation), and four general outcome categories (number of solutions, time to solution, quality, and process measures). The classification scheme is compared with recent attempts to define "ideal" characteristics of measures, and seven general criteria are proposed for evaluating problem-solving tasks. Twelve categories of tasks commonly used in research are classified and evaluated. Concept identification, switchlight problems, verbal mazes, and simulations are concluded to be tasks that most closely satisfy all evaluation criteria, although each has some problems. Implications for improvement of measures of problem-solving are indicated. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {Deficiencies in engineering education have been exhaustively enumerated in recent years. Engineering schools and professors have been told by countless panels and blue-ribbon commissions and, in the United States, by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology that we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals; teach more about " real-world " engineering design and operations, including quality management; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering; offer more and better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the connections between technology and society; and reduce the number of hours in the engineering curriculum so that the average student can complete it in four years. 1 This is an impressive wish list—especially when the last item is included—that cannot possibly be fulfilled using the approach to educating engineers that has predominated in the past 50 years. If, for example, courses continue to be confined to single subjects (heat transfer in one course, thermodynamics in another, environmental engineering in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or seven-year curriculum to produce engineers who have the desired proficiency in the fundamentals and are conversant with methods of modern engineering practice, culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical judgment and creativity. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible unless more efficient and effective ways to cover the material can be found. The reality is that better teaching methods exist. The literature in general education, technical education, and educational psychology is replete with methods that have been shown to facilitate learning more effectively than the traditional single-discipline lecturing approach. Unfortunately, these developments have so far had relatively little impact on mainstream engineering education. Although their content has changed in some ways and the students use calculators and computers instead of slide rules, many engineering classes in 1999 are taught in exactly the same way that engineering classes in 1959 were taught.},

In this work, we present a collaborative game that was developed to assist students in learning algorithms and we explore its learning capabilities. The game aims to assist students in learning constraint satisfaction algorithms and it is based on the map coloring game. In the context of the game, students can experiment and apply the algorithms in various learning activities and training scenarios. The game has been integrated into the curriculum of the artificial intelligence course in our university. An evaluation study was conducted in real classroom conditions and revealed quite promising results which indicate that the game is an effective way to enhance students' motivation, engagement and interest and also it helps students to deeper understand the functionality of constraint satisfaction algorithms.},

abstract = {Governments, the media, the information technology industry and scientists publicly argue that information and communication technologies (ICT) will bring about an inevitable transition from "industrial" to "information" or "knowledge-based" economies and societies. It is assumed that all aspects of our economic and social lives, in both the public and private spheres, will be radically different from what they are today. The World Summit on the Information Society (Geneva 2003 - Tunis 2005) shows the importance of a worldwide reflection on those topics. Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society explores the ICT policies of different nations and regions such as Africa, China, Europe, and India. The authors assess the arguments surrounding the impending new age, as well as some of the more sensitive issues of its developments. This progress will signal an expansion of ICT in many domains - the so-called ubiquity - such as in the workplace, the home, government, and education and it will affect privacy and professional ethics. The expansion will also encompass all parts of the earth, particularly developing countries. Such growth must take place in the context of historical dimensions and should underscore the accountability of professionals in the field.The intent of this book is to address these issues and to serve as a handbook of IFIP's TC9 "Computers and Society" committee. Thirty authors from twelve countries consider the ICT policies with their associated perspectives and they explore what may be the information age and the digital society of tomorrow. The book provides reflection on today's complex society and addresses the uncertain developments rising from an increasingly global and technologically connected world.Jacques Berleur is at the University of Namur, Belgium, and Chrisanthi Avgerou at the London School of Economics, United Kingdom.},

The findings can be used to make decisions about initiatives for increasing retention. Eight indices of student characteristics and perceptions were developed using the research-based Student Experience of the Major Survey: student-student interaction; student-faculty interaction; collaborative learning opportunities; pace/workload/prior experience with programming; teaching assistants; classroom climate/pedagogy; meaningful assignments; and racism/sexism. A linear regression revealed that student-student interaction was the most powerful predictor of students' intention to persist in the major beyond the introductory course. Other factors predicting intention to persist were pace/workload/prior experience and male gender. The findings suggest that computer science departments interested in increasing retention of students set structured expectations for student-student interaction in ways that integrate peer involvement as a mainstream activity rather than making it optional or extracurricular. They also suggest departments find ways to manage programming experience gaps in CS1.},

abstract = {What knowledge does learning programming require? Prior work has focused on theorizing program writing and problem solving skills. We examine program comprehension and propose a formal theory of program tracing knowledge based on control low paths through an interpreter program's source code. Because novices cannot understand the interpreter's programming language nota-tion, we transform it into causal relationships from code tokens to instructions to machine state changes. To teach this knowledge, we propose a comprehension--rst pedagogy based on causal infer-ence, by showing, explaining, and assessing each path by stepping through concrete examples within many example programs. To assess this pedagogy, we built PLTutor, a tutorial system with a curriculum of example programs. We evaluate learning gains among self-selected CS1 students using a block randomized lab study comparing PLTutor with Codecademy, a writing tutorial. In our small study, we end some evidence of improved learning gains on the SCS1, with average learning gains of PLTutor 60{\%} higher than Codecademy (gain of 3.89 vs. 2.42 out of 27 questions). ese gains strongly predicted midterms (R 2 =.64) only for PLTutor participants, whose grades showed less variation and no failures.},

The turtle machine is well-known for giving students an intuitive understanding of fundamental, procedural programming principles. In this chapter we present our experiences with resurrecting the Logo turtle in a new object-oriented way and using it in an introductory object-oriented programming course. While, at the outset, we wanted to achieve the same qualities as the original turtle (understanding of state, control flow, instructions), we realized that the concept of turtles is well-suited for teaching a whole range of funda-mental principles. We have successfully used turtles to give students an intuitive understanding of central object-oriented concepts and principles such as object, class, message passing, behaviour, object identification, inheritance, and recursion. Finally, we have used turtles to show students the use of abstraction in practice because the turtle package, at a late stage in the course, becomes a handy graphics library used in a context otherwise unrelated to the turtles.},

@article{Roberts1993,
abstract = {In 1991, the Stanford Department of Computer Science decided to abandon Pascal in its introductory computer science courses and to adopt ANSI C as the language of instruction. We based this decision on several factors: the inadequacy of standard Pascal as a base for teaching modern programming concepts, the need to prepare our students for more advanced courses in which they will be expected to use C for programming projects, and increasing pressure from students and faculty throughout the School of Engineering for instruction in a language that has become the industry standard. We also believe that it is not reasonable to expect students to learn C on their own; students must receive instruction in C in order to become good C programmers. C has several known deficiencies that make it a challenging language to teach. Based on our experience at Stanford, we believe that it is possible to minimize the problems associated with teaching C at the introductory level by applying standard software engineering strategies—procedural abstraction, modular decomposition, and information hiding—to good pedagogical effect. This paper expands on the reasons behind Stanford's decision to adopt C and summarizes the pedagogical approach},

It was found that, with certain modifications to the process, it was possible to undertake an SLR within a limited time period and to produce valid results. Based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, the student found 28 publications reporting empirical studies of pair programming, of which nine publications were used for data extraction and analysis. Results of the review indicates that whilst pair programming has little effect on the marks obtained for examinations and assignments, it can significantly improve the pass and retention rates and the students' confidence and enjoyment of programming. Following the student study, experienced reviewers re-applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria to the 28 publications and carried out data extraction and synthesis using the resulting papers. A comparison of the student's results and those of the experienced reviewers is presented. {\&}copy; 2009 IEEE.},

Modern day computing jobs demand design, communication, and collaborative work skills as well. Since traditional instructional methods in computing education tend to focus on programming skills, we believe that a fundamental rethinking of computing education is in order. We are exploring a new “studio-based ” pedagogy that actively engages undergraduate students in collaborative, design-oriented learning. Adapted from architectural education, the studio-based instructional model emphasizes learning activities in which students (a) construct personalized solutions to assigned computing problems, and (b) present solutions to their instructors and peers for feedback and discussion within the context of “design crits. ” We describe and motivate the studio-based approach, review previous efforts to apply it to computer science education, and propose an agenda for multi-institutional research into the design and impact of studio-based instructional models. We invite educators to participate in a community of research and practice to advance studio-based learning in computing education.},

The report continues a long tradition of recommendations for academic programs in computing-related fields dating back to 1965, as described in Chapter 2 of the report. This volume of the report outlines a set of recommendations for undergraduate programs in computer science. As described in Chapter 1, the CC2001 report will eventually consist of several volumes containing separate recommendations for other computing disciplines, including computer engineering, software engineering, and information systems. Those reports are each under the control of separate committees and will be published as they are completed. Highlights of this report include the following:},

abstract = {1 Software to call single nucleotide polymorphisms or related genetic variants has converged 2 on the variant call format (VCF) as the output format of choice. This has created a need 3 for tools to work with VCF files. While an increasing number of software exists to read 4 VCF data, many only extract the genotypes without including the data associated with each 5 genotype that describes its quality. We created the R package vcfR to address this issue. We 6 developed a VCF file exploration tool implemented in the R language because R provides an 7 interactive experience and an environment that is commonly used for genetic data analysis. ability to visualize how various parameterizations of the data affect the results. Additional 11 tools are included to integrate sequence (FASTA) and annotation data (GFF) for visualiza-12 tion of genomic regions such as chromosomes. Conversion functions translate data from the 13 vcfR data structure to formats used by other R genetics packages. Computationally intensive 14 functions are implemented in C++ to improve performance. Use of these tools is intended 15 to facilitate VCF data exploration, including intuitive methods for data quality control and 16 easy export to other R packages for further analysis. VcfR thus provides essential, novel tools 17 currently not available in R.},

Piso – Trelew – Te-Fax: 02965 42 84 02 Resumen El objetivo de este trabajo es compartir las estrategias que nos dieron buen resultado para salvar algunas de las dificultades que encontramos en el proceso de aprendizaje de los alumnos ingresantes para los conceptos b{\'{a}}sicos de algor{\'{i}}tmica y programaci{\'{o}}n. Palabras claves: programaci{\'{o}}n – algoritmo – ense{\~{n}}anza probl{\'{e}}mica Introducci{\'{o}}n En todas las carreras de inform{\'{a}}tica existe alguna materia de programaci{\'{o}}n en el primer a{\~{n}}o, en nuestro caso esta primer materia es Algor{\'{i}}tmica y Programaci{\'{o}}n que se dicta en el segundo cuatrimestre, luego de An{\'{a}}lisis Matem{\'{a}}tico I, {\'{A}}lgebra y Geometr{\'{i}}a e Introducci{\'{o}}n a la Computaci{\'{o}}n. Tal como acontece en la mayor{\'{i}}a de las primeras materias de una carrera universitaria, confluyen diferentes situaciones que dificultan el aprendizaje: o Falta de conciencia estudiantil o Desinter{\'{e}}s por sus estudios en general o Apat{\'{i}}a por la materia en particular o Dificultades para interpretar consignas o Dificultades para expresarse o Carencia de h{\'{a}}bitos de lectura o Carencia de disciplina para estudiar o Escasa retenci{\'{o}}n de los conocimientos adquiridos o Bajo grado de reflexi{\'{o}}n, de independencia y de generalizaci{\'{o}}n. Estas situaciones sumadas a las inherentes a la asignatura provocan alta deserci{\'{o}}n y bajo rendimiento que se refleja en una relaci{\'{o}}n aprobados / inscriptos muy baja. TE{\&}ET'06 117 Algor{\'{i}}tmica y Programaci{\'{o}}n es una materia de vital importancia en la formaci{\'{o}}n del alumno, el {\'{e}}xito o fracaso en ella influye decisivamente en las restantes, ya que no quedan casi posibilidades de seguir avanzando en la carrera si no se logran las competencias requeridas. Por lo tanto es imperativo buscar las mejores estrategias que ayuden a efectivizar el proceso de ense{\~{n}}anza-aprendizaje y la calidad de los resultados. En este sentido, a lo largo de muchos a{\~{n}}os venimos observando, investigando, proponiendo y probando estrategias que den mejor resultado para la ense{\~{n}}anza-aprendizaje de la programaci{\'{o}}n. Estas estrategias abarcan desde la forma did{\'{a}}ctica de impartir los conocimientos hasta la distribuci{\'{o}}n de las horas de clase.},

abstract = {La docencia reglada en temas de cooperaci{\'{o}}n dentro de nuestras propias universidades es un aspecto central de la Cooperaci{\'{o}}n Universitaria para el Desarrollo. En el presente trabajo se recoge la experiencia desarrollada por el Grupo de Tecnolog{\'{i}}as Apropiadas de la Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, tras seis a{\~{n}}os impartiendo asignaturas de libre elecci{\'{o}}n en el tema y dos a{\~{n}}os m{\'{a}}s impartiendo dos asignaturas optativas en los grados adaptados a Bolonia y abiertas a un amplio abanico de titulaciones. La oferta actual se plantea como una introducci{\'{o}}n sobre la realidad del subdesarrollo, la cooperaci{\'{o}}n y las pautas de adecuaci{\'{o}}n tecnol{\'{o}}gica que deben seguirse, todo ello realizado desde un enfoque pr{\'{a}}ctico. Se presenta una discusi{\'{o}}n sobre las motivaciones y los objetivos y sobre los contenidos y la metodolog{\'{i}}a que debieran incluirse para una visi{\'{o}}n global y aplicada del problema. Finalmente se presenta el programa y organizaci{\'{o}}n de las asignaturas que se ofertan actualmente. L{\'{i}}nea Tem{\'{a}}tica: 2. La actividad universitaria como pr{\'{a}}ctica de cooperaci{\'{o}}n al desarrollo INTRODUCCI{\'{O}}N -JUSTIFICACI{\'{O}}N La necesidad de incluir asignaturas que traten aspectos del subdesarrollo y la cooperaci{\'{o}}n dentro de los planes de estudio universitarios aparece reflejada en m{\'{u}}ltiples documentos. El C{\'{o}}digo de Conducta de las Universidades en Materia de Cooperaci{\'{o}}n al Desarrollo establece como prioridades de acci{\'{o}}n de la universidad la docencia y la investigaci{\'{o}}n, a las que define como el {\'{a}}mbito natural de actuaci{\'{o}}n de la misma. En el art{\'{i}}culo 19 se especifica claramente que " las Universidades estudiar{\'{a}}n las f{\'{o}}rmulas necesarias para el reconocimiento acad{\'{e}}mico de las actividades propias de la cooperaci{\'{o}}n al desarrollo ({\ldots}) favoreciendo la implantaci{\'{o}}n de asignaturas... " Al mismo tiempo, el proceso de Bolonia, actualmente en implantaci{\'{o}}n en las universidades espa{\~{n}}olas, incluye dentro de sus objetivos program{\'{a}}ticos, desde los primeros documentos hasta la actualidad, la introducci{\'{o}}n de conceptos de solidaridad y cooperaci{\'{o}}n para el desarrollo en los planes de estudio. Es evidente que la docencia es uno de los {\'{a}}mbitos b{\'{a}}sicos de la actividad universitaria. Sin embargo, y pese al volumen alcanzado por las acciones de Cooperaci{\'{o}}n Universitaria para el Desarrollo (CUD), no se ha llegado a una estabilizaci{\'{o}}n razonable en este aspecto. Aunque toda la legislaci{\'{o}}n sobre planes de estudios propone su inserci{\'{o}}n de forma transversal en los estudios, esta inclusi{\'{o}}n, dentro de las asignaturas " normales " de una titulaci{\'{o}}n, plantea diversos problemas, en especial los de implicaci{\'{o}}n real del profesorado y la necesidad de una formaci{\'{o}}n previa y especializada del mismo. Por ello, una soluci{\'{o}}n alternativa es la de la elaboraci{\'{o}}n de asignaturas vinculadas a los planes de estudio y centradas en estos temas. Los objetivos de estas asignaturas deben ser tanto de sensibilizaci{\'{o}}n y divulgaci{\'{o}}n como formativos y, en {\'{u}}ltimo punto, t{\'{e}}cnicos, recogiendo as{\'{i}} todo el espectro de motivaciones, intereses y formas de acercamiento al tema del alumnado.},

El m{\'{e}}todo del estudio de casos pertenece al grupo de metodolog{\'{i}}as docentes denominadas " activas " a causa del papel destacado del alumno en el proceso de ense{\~{n}}anza-aprendizaje (Bain, 2005; Finkel, 2008). En efecto, la metodolog{\'{i}}a del estudio de casos aporta beneficios al estudiante, como un mayor desarrollo de habilidades y actitudes, mayor retenci{\'{o}}n de la informaci{\'{o}}n y mayor capacidad de construir relaciones entre el conocimiento inicial y final (Novak, 1998; De Miguel D{\'{i}}az, 2006). Como recoge la literatura sobre este m{\'{e}}todo, el estudio de casos ya hace tiempo que se aplica en facultades de Derecho y Business, pero se ha ido ampliando a otros campos, adoptando diferentes formas (Reynolds, 1990; Wassermann, 1994). Un objetivo com{\'{u}}n es plantear situaciones que presentan problemas de soluci{\'{o}}n m{\'{u}}ltiple; en consecuencia, la b{\'{u}}squeda de la soluci{\'{o}}n fomenta la reflexi{\'{o}}n colectiva y el aprendizaje plural. En este texto quiero mostrar un ejemplo de estudio de casos en el campo de la Ciencia Pol{\'{i}}tica. El texto se estructura siguiendo las fases claves del m{\'{e}}todo (objetivo, problema, preguntas, desarrollo en el aula y evaluaci{\'{o}}n) (Wassermann, 1994).

abstract = {A R{\&}I{\&}i process for a knowledge management system development is presented. It transforms different institutions experiences into organisational knowledge applicable to an entire sector, the higher education one specifically. The knowledge management system allows classifying, organising, distributing and facilitating the application of the knowledge generated by the faculty. A study, with more than 1000 system users, reflects that the system helps to the faculty in the way they perform educational innovation activities. The supported model integrates both Nonaka's epistemological and ontological spirals. This allows defining ontologies and used them in order to transform the individual knowledge into organisational one. The knowledge management system encapsulates complex logic expressions and ontologies management, making easy for the users obtaining successful results that may organise in their own way, becoming a powerful knowledge management process that combines epistemological and ontological knowledge spirals to convert individual experiences in educational innovation into organisational knowledge in the higher education sector.},

However, that kind of learning, known as informal learning, is usually invisible for people in charge of organizations. This is because either the learner is not aware of having learned something or because he/she is not able to show or make visible this type of learning to other. In order to facilitate the exploitation of this knowledge, TRAILER project poses a methodology supported by a technological ecosystem. This methodology is quite complex; it involves different stakeholders and components. For defining the methodology, a flexible and understandable notation was used, Business Process Model Notation. It helps in the designing and implementation of the solution and it also has been used to guide experts during the methodology testing.},

Diversity among group members is a key condition for the emergence of collective intelligence, but maintaining diversity is challenging in the face of social pressure to imitate one's peers. Through an evolutionary game-theoretic model of collective prediction, we investigate the role that incentives may play in maintaining useful diversity. We show that market-based incentive systems produce herding effects, reduce information available to the group, and restrain collective intelligence. Therefore, we propose an incentive scheme that rewards accurate minority predictions and show that this produces optimal diversity and collective predictive accuracy. We conclude that real world systems should reward those who have shown accuracy when the majority opinion has been in error.},

Using the collective intelligence of a crowd opens a new range of business opportunities. In fact, crowdsourcing has led to the emergence of entirely new business models. Such crowd-based business models (CBBMs) can lead to an important competitive advantage while simultaneously presenting new challenges to entrepreneurs and executives. This article identifies and discusses three key challenges in designing and managing CBBMs: determining (1) the crowd's value to the firm, (2) how to create superior value for the crowd, and (3) how to capture value from the crowd effectively. Building on the crowd capital perspective and an analysis of the tactics and practices of successful CBBMs, this article offers propositions on how to overcome these challenges and manage such business models effectively. The identified practices can inspire decision makers when designing innovative CBBMs for their industries. Finally, the article concludes with a framework with the key decisions and tactics for effectively managing CBBMs.},

The authors observed two collective systems as examples of the dynamic processes of complex networks – the wiki course PeSO at the Universidad de Los Andes, Bogot{\'{a}}, Colombia, and an agent-based model inspired by wiki systems. Findings – The results of the wiki course PeSO and the model are contrasted with a random network baseline model.

Using a quasi-experimental design, we collected quantitative data to compare participants' conceptual understanding, attitudes, and motivation in the biological sciences across two contexts that employed different active-learning strategies and that were facilitated by unique instructors. Students participated in either graphic organizer/worksheet activities or clicker-based case studies. After controlling for demographic and presemester affective differences, we found that students in both active-learning environments displayed similar and significant learning gains. In terms of attitudinal and motivational data, significant differences were observed for two attitudinal measures. Specifically, those students who had participated in graphic organizer/worksheet activities demonstrated more expert-like attitudes related to their enjoyment of biology and ability to make real-world connections. However, all motivational and most attitudinal data were not significantly different between the students in the two learning environments. These data reinforce the notion that active learning is associated with conceptual change and suggests that more research is needed to examine the differential effects of varying active-learning strategies on students' attitudes and motivation in the domain.},

abstract = {Today, so-called "smart" or "intelligent" systems heavily rely on machine learning techniques to adjust their behavior by means of sample data (e.g., sensor observations). But, it will be more and more complicated or even impossible to provide those data at design-time of that system. As a consequence, these systems have to learn at run-time. Moreover, these systems will have to self-organize their learning processes. They have to decide which information or knowledge source they use at which time, depending on the quality of the information or knowledge they collect, the availability of these sources, the costs of gathering the information or knowledge, etc. With this article, we propose opportunistic collaborative interactive learning (O-CIL) as a new learning principle for future, even "smarter" systems. O-CIL will enable a "lifelong" or "neverending" learning of such systems in open-ended (i.e., time-variant) environments, based on active behavior and collaboration of such systems. Not only these systems collaborate, also humans collaborate either directly or indirectly by interacting with these systems. The article characterizes O-CIL, summarizes related work, sketches research challenges, and illustrates O-CIL with some preliminary results. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

Toward this direction, we develop collective learning extension leveraging social media and implement in three IS courses at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. Collective learning extension is adaptable to existing learning paradigms. Collective learning extension is not a new learning paradigm but it is supporting the existing learning paradigms. Collective learning extension creates a curriculum development strategy that produces a nimble curriculum adaptive to the rapidly evolving technologies. It encourages collaborative and participatory learning among students and promotes self-learning, critical thinking, and non-linear learning skills. Collective learning extension emphasizes teamwork, coordination, and strengthening interpersonal skills, preparing the students as the next-generation workforce. Collective learning extension uses social media technologies for learners. It encourages students for better collaboration. In this research, students experience is evaluated on collective learning extension and data is collected from formative and summative surveys in the class.},

abstract = {—Active learning (AL) is a machine learning paradigm where an active learner has to train a model (e.g., a classifier) which is in principle trained in a supervised way. AL has to be done by means of a data set where a low fraction of samples (also termed data points or observations) are labeled. To obtain labels for the unlabeled samples, the active learner has to ask an oracle (e.g., a human expert) for labels. In most cases, the goal is to maximize some metric assessing the task performance (e.g., the classification accuracy) and to minimize the number of queries at the same time. In this article, we first briefly discuss the state-of-the-art in the field of AL. Then, we propose the concept of dedicated collaborative interactive learning (D-CIL) and describe some research challenges. With D-CIL, we will overcome many of the harsh limitations of current AL. In particular, we envision scenarios where the expert may be wrong for various reasons. There also might be several or even many experts with different expertise who collaborate, the experts may label not only samples but also supply knowledge at a higher level such as rules, and we consider that the labeling costs depend on many conditions. Moreover, human experts may even profit by improving their own knowledge when they get feedback from the active learner.},

As one of the most prominent characteristics of research in AI 2.0 era, crowd intelligence has attracted much attention from both industry and research communities. Specifically, crowd intelligence provides a novel problem-solving paradigm through gathering the intelligence of crowds to address challenges. In particular, due to the rapid development of the sharing economy, crowd intelligence not only becomes a new approach to solving scientific challenges, but has also been integrated into all kinds of application scenarios in daily life, e.g., online-to-offline (O2O) application, real-time traffic monitoring, and logistics management. In this paper, we survey existing studies of crowd intelligence. First, we describe the concept of crowd intelligence, and explain its relationship to the existing related concepts, e.g., crowdsourcing and human computation. Then, we introduce four categories of representative crowd intelligence platforms. We summarize three core research problems and the state-of-the-art techniques of crowd intelligence. Finally, we discuss promising future research directions of crowd intelligence.},

abstract = {We propose a new probabilistic graphical model that jointly models the difficulties of questions, the abilities of participants and the correct answers to questions in aptitude testing and crowdsourcing settings. We devise an active learning/adaptive testing scheme based on a greedy minimization of expected model entropy, which allows a more efficient resource allocation by dynamically choosing the next question to be asked based on the previous responses. We present experimental results that confirm the ability of our model to infer the required parameters and demonstrate that the adaptive testing scheme requires fewer questions to obtain the same accuracy as a static test scenario.},

@article{Williams,
abstract = {A formal pair programming experiment was run at North Carolina to empirically assess the educational efficacy of the technique in a CS1 course. Results indicate that students who practice pair programming perform better on programming projects and are more likely to succeed by completing the class with a C or better. Student pairs are more self -sufficient which reduces their reliance on the teaching staff. Qualitatively, paired students demonstrate higher-order thinking skills than students who worked alone. These results are supportive of pair programming as a collaborative learning technique. In industry, programmers collaborate for the majority of their day. In Peopleware (DeMarco and Lister, 1987), it was reported that software developers generally spend 30{\%} of their time working alone, 50{\%} of their time working with one other person, and 20{\%} of their time working with two or more people. Yet, most often when completing their degree, programmers must learn to program alone; collaboration is considered cheating. This is unfortunate not only because collaboration is encouraged and required in a student's future professional life, but there are also findings that cooperative and collaborative pedagogies are beneficial to students (Slavin 1980, 1990). An emerging software development methodology, Extreme Programming (XP) (Beck, 2000), has recently popularized a structured form of programmer collaboration called pair programming. Pair programming is a style of programming in which two programmers work side-by-side at one computer, continuously collaborating on the same design, algorithm, code, or test. One of the pair, called the driver, types at the computer or writes down a design. The other partner, called the navigator, has many jobs. One is to observe the work of the driver – looking for defects in the work of the driver. The navigator has a much more objective point of view and is the strategic, long-range thinker. Additionally, the driver and the navigator can brainstorm on-demand at any time. An effective pair programming relationship is very active. The driver and the navigator communicate, if only through utterances, at least every 45 to 60 seconds. Periodically, it's also very important to switch roles between the driver and the navigator. Research results (Williams, Kessler et al., 2001; Cockburn {\&} Williams, 2002) indicate that pair programmers produce higher quality code in about half the time when compared with solo programmers. These results were based on experiments held at the University of Utah in the senior-level Software Engineering course (Williams, 2000; Williams {\&} Kessler, 2000; Williams {\&} Kessler 2001). The focus of this research was on the affordability of the practice of pair programming, the ability of the practice to yield higher quality code without significant increases in time/cost. However, the researchers observed educational benefits for the student pair programmers. These benefits included superior results on graded assignments, increased satisfaction/reduced frustration from the students, increased confidence from the students on their project results, and reduced workload of the teaching staff. These observations inspired further research directed at the use of pair programming in educating Computer Science students. This paper details the results of an experiment that was held at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in 2001. The experiment was specifically designed to assess the efficacy of pair programming in an introductory classroom. Background},

abstract = {Summary What can happen if we combine the best ideas from the Social Web and Semantic Web? The Social Web is an ecosystem of participation, where value is created by the aggregation of many individual user contributions. The Semantic Web is an ecosystem of data, where value is created by the integration of structured data from many sources. What applications can best synthesize the strengths of these two approaches, to create a new level of value that is both rich with human participation and powered by well-structured information? This paper proposes a class of applications called collective knowledge systems, which unlock the “collective intelligence” of the Social Web with knowledge representation and reasoning techniques of the Semantic Web.},

@article{Heylighen1999,
abstract = {Collective intelligence is defined as the ability of a group to solve more problems than its individual members. It is argued that the obstacles created by individual cognitive limits and the difficulty of coordination can be overcome by using a collective mental map (CMM). A CMM is defined as an external memory with shared read/write access, that represents problem states, actions and preferences for actions. It can be formalized as a weighted, directed graph. The creation of a network of pheromone trails by ant colonies points us to some basic mechanisms of CMM development: averaging of individual preferences, amplification of weak links by positive feedback, and integration of specialised subnetworks through division of labor. Similar mechanisms can be used to transform the World-Wide Web into a CMM, by supplementing it with weighted links. Two types of algorithms are explored: 1) the co-occurrence of links in web pages or user selections can be used to compute a matrix of link strengths, thus generalizing the technique of " collaborative filtering " ; 2) learning web rules ex-tract information from a user's sequential path through the web in order to change link strengths and create new links. The resulting weighted web can be used to facilitate problem-solving by suggesting related links to the user, or, more powerfully, by supporting a software agent that discovers relevant documents through spreading activation.},

We have used a kick-start activation in the beginning of an introductory programming course (CS1) to set the record straight. A kick-start activation means introducing the deep structure of programming before the surface structure by making the students solve a certain type of problem in the first lecture. The problem is related to a realistic computer program, simple enough for everyone to understand and allow students to participate in debugging. A visualization-based approach helps making the example more concrete for students. In this article we present the concept kick-start activation and one concrete example. To support the exam-ple, we have also developed a visualization using the visualization tool JHA E. We got positive feedback on the example and suggest further development of kick-start activations in order to make the beginning of learning programming more motivating for students.},

abstract = {Thirty-one years ago, the ACM Computing Curricula used the terms " CS1 " and " CS2 " to designate the first two two courses in the introductory sequence of a computer sci-ence major. While computer science education has greatly changed since that time, we still refer to introduction to pro-gramming courses as CS1 and basic data structures courses as CS2. This common shorthand is then used to enable students to transfer between institutions and as a base of many research studies. In this paper we show that while there is wide agreement on the connotation of CS1 and CS2, there is little agreement as to the denotation of these terms. Surveying CS1 and CS2 instructors, we find little agreement on how important various topics are to each of these course and less agreement on how well students master the material. Even after limit-ing the analysis to whether a topic has ANY important or students complete a course with ANY mastery of the mate-rial, we continue to find significant disagreements between instructors.},

Los decisores de las organizaciones necesitan de instrumentos que les ayuden a orientar las estrategias en su organizaci{\'{o}}n, para ello pueden valerse de la pr{\'{a}}ctica de la Vigilancia Tecnol{\'{o}}gica e Inteligencia Competitiva (VTIC). Un proceso de VTIC organizado, sistem{\'{a}}tico y continuado en el tiempo, puede apoyarse en el uso de herramientas de software. El presente art{\'{i}}culo pretende dar una visi{\'{o}}n del estado del arte en la materia, se{\~{n}}alando los tipos de software, sus ventajas, sus desventajas y cual podr{\'{i}}a ser un buen camino para la elecci{\'{o}}n de un buen abanico de herramientas. No obstante lo anterior, tambi{\'{e}}n reiteramos la necesidad de utilizar estas herramientas enmarcadas en proceso de VTIC muy definido y que ellas sean soporte del proceso y no el fin.},
