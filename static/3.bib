@inproceedings{Nuutila2008,
abstract = {. We describe an implementation of an introductory programming course using the seven steps method of problem-based learning (PBL). In that method students working in small groups learn programming by trying to make sense of complex real-world problems, so-called cases. We outline the organization of the course and give examples of possible cases. We then describe our experiences with the role of tutoring in the method and the properties of programming-related PBL cases. We carried out experiments with tutorless PBL to see if the method could scale up to courses with large numbers of students. The results were disappointing. Student questionnairies reveal possible reasons. Firstly, when a tutor is not present, the students become insecure if they are progressing in a fruitful direction and thus come frustrated and lose motivation. Secondly, the behaviour of a group may deteriorate, i.e., become unbalanced or turn into irrelevant chatting. We have also analyzed the properties of our PBL cases, since it is not straightforward to identify good PBL cases in the area of programming. In the analysis we try to spell out what the concept open-ended real-world problem means and how it is affected if the focus of work is on explanation or design. We relate the cases to different aspects of programming skills and present student feedback on the cases. 1.},

abstract = {Research suggests that pair programming increases student performance and decreases student attrition. However, less is known about the ways in which pair programming can unintentionally lead to inequitable relationships between students. Audio data were collected from pair programming interactions in a sixth-grade computer science enrichment program designed to promote equity. However, even in this context, there were surprising instances of inequity. We measured inequity by documenting the distribution of students' questions, commands, and total talk within four pairs. Analysis revealed that less equitable pairs sought to complete tasks quickly and this may have led to patterns of marginalization and domination. Notably, this focus on speed was not evident in the more equitable pairs. These findings are important for understanding mechanisms of inequity and designing equitable collaboration practices in computer science.},

abstract = {This paper starts with a presentation of experiences from a joint project where courses in infor- matics have been developed together with industry partners. The industry partners were of vari- ous size. Some of them were producers of for example cars and aero planes and also making Technical documentation for their products, while other companies were subcontractors for the Technical Communication. A problem that occurs in the Technical Communication sector is that companies have big problems to find and employ staff with a suitable competence. Therefore the project aimed to analyze the need for competence development within organizations dealing with Technical Communication, in order to develop suitable courses for students to obtain employabil- ity. A model for course development based on Triple loop learning has been developed and is presented. The steps in the model are: State of the art within the area of Technical Communica- tion; Identification of requirements and quality requirement for Technical Communication; Iden- tification of need of competencies; Identification of existing courses and training; Course Devel- opment; Realization of courses; Evaluation of courses and effects of the courses; Further devel- opment of courses. The first step and part of step two was conducted as a literature study, while the other part of step two and step three was accomplished with help of interviews with different stakeholders. The course development and the realization of the courses were carried through to- gether with the industry partners in the project. When it comes to co-operation between academia and industry everyone is convinced that it is a good thing. Our experience is also that there is much benefit in collaboration. However the ways of communication have to be considered. Balancing differences between different companies needs and balancing differences between the academic requirements on higher education and in- dustry partners desires regarding the courses have to be considered. A conclusion from the project is that it is difficult to in one hand catch all needs and requirements from the stakeholders from different levels in the companies and on the other hand get a balance between different stakeholders interests.

abstract = {In large-scale natural disasters, humans are likely to fail when they attempt to reach high-risk sites or act in search and rescue operations. Robots, however, outdo their counterparts in surviving the hazards and handling the search and rescue missions due to their multiple and diverse sensing and actuation capabilities. The dynamic formation of optimal coalition of these heterogeneous robots for cost efficiency is very challenging and research in the area is gaining more and more attention. In this paper, we propose a novel heuristic. Since the population of robots in large-scale disaster settings is very large, we rely on Quantum Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (QMOPSO). The problem is modeled as a multi-objective optimization problem. Simulations with different test cases and metrics, and comparison with other algorithms such as NSGA-II and SPEA-II are carried out. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing algorithms not only in terms of convergence but also in terms of diversity and processing time.},

abstract = {Motivation is a very important factor for successful instruction. This factor is especially relevant in collaborative learning contexts, where social interaction plays an important role. In this paper we present an evaluation of motivation in 139 students who were instructed under four pedagogical approaches: traditional lecture, collaborative learning, collaborative learning guided by CIF (an instructional framework for collaborative learning), and collaborative learning guided by CIF and supported by MoCAS (a collaborative learning tool). We considered the four dimensions of motivation according to self-determination theory. The statistical results show that, in global terms, students were more motivated by jointly using the collaborative instructional approach CIF and the MoCAS tool than by using a collaborative approach. Detailed analysis of the different kinds of motivation yields mixed results. Students who were instructed with CIF and especially those students instructed with CIF and MoCAS exhibited higher intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students instructed with CIF and MoCAS were the most extrinsically motivated via identified regulation. With respect to extrinsic motivation via external regulation, students instructed in a traditional, individual way were more motivated than students instructed collaboratively. Finally, high levels of amotivation were also associated to instruction using CIF and MoCAS. In summary, our results suggest that CIF and MoCAS are associated with high levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a finding that can aid in improving the learning processes, but they are also, unexpectedly, associated with amotivation, suggesting an overall increase in activation in the students who show mixed motivators.},

abstract = {Wikis today are being used as a tool to conduct collaborative writing assignments in classrooms. However, typical Wikis do not adequately address the assessment of individual student contributions toward their groups or provide any automated group formation mechanism. To improve these aspects, we have designed and implemented ClassroomWiki - a web-based collaborative Wiki writing tool. For the students, ClassroomWiki provides a web interface for writing and revising their group's Wiki and a topic-based forum for discussing their ideas during collaboration. When the students collaborate, ClassroomWiki tracks all student activities and builds detailed student models that represent their contributions toward their groups. For the teacher, ClassroomWiki provides a multiagent framework that uses the student models to form student groups to improve the collaborative learning of students. To investigate the impact of ClassroomWiki, we have conducted a three-week-long collaborative Wiki writing assignment in a university-level history course. The results suggest that ClassroomWiki can 1) improve the collaborative learning outcome of the students by its group formation framework, 2) help the teacher better assess a student's contribution toward his or her group and avoid free riding, and 3) facilitate specific and precise teacher intervention with accurate and detailed tracking of student activities.},

abstract = {This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice.},

abstract = {Educational psychology findings indicate that active processing (such as self-testing) is more effective for learning than passive reading or even rereading. Electronic books (ebooks) can include much more than static pictures and text. Ebooks can promote better learning by increasing the reader's interaction with the material through multi-modal learning supports, worked examples, and low cognitive load practice activities. For example, multiple choice questions with immediate feedback can help identify misconceptions and gaps in knowledge. Parsons problems, which are mixed up code segments that have to be put in the correct order, require learners to think about the order of the statements in a solution without having to worry about syntax errors. Our research group has been applying concepts from educational psychology to make learning from ebooks more effective and efficient. This paper reports on an observational study and log file analysis on the use of an ebook that incorporates interactive activities. We provide evidence that learners engaged in the interactive activities, but used some types of activities more than others. We also found evidence that learners encountered some "desirable difficulties" which can improve learning. This descriptive study informs a research agenda to improve the quality of instruction in computing education.},

abstract = {We investigated students' use of program visualizations (PVs) that were tightly integrated into the electronic book of an introductory course on programming. A quantitative analysis of logs showed that most students, and beginners especially, used the PVs, even where the PV did not directly affect their grade. Students commonly spent more time studying certain steps than others, suggesting they used the PVs attentively. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of students appeared to gloss over some key animation steps, something that future improvements to pedagogy may address. Overall, the results suggest that integrating PVs into an ebook can promote student engagement and has been fairly successful in the studied context. More research is needed to understand the differences between our results and earlier ones, and to assess the generalizability of our findings.},

abstract = {Introductory computer science courses cultivate the next generation of computer scientists. The impressions students take away from these courses are crucial, setting the tone for the rest of the students' computer science education. It is known that students struggle with many concepts central to computer science, struggles that could be alleviated in part through hands-on practice and individualized instruction. However, even the best existing instructional practices do not facilitate individualized hands-on support for students at large. We have built JavaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory computer science, which works alongside students to support them through both cognitive (skills and knowledge) and affective (emotion-based) feedback. JavaTutor aims to make advances in interactive, scalable student support. JavaTutor's behaviors were developed within a novel framework that leverages machine learning to acquire tutorial strategies from data collected within tutorial sessions between novice students and experienced human tutors. This demo presents an overview of the data-driven development of JavaTutor and shows how JavaTutor assesses and responds to students' contextualized needs. It is hoped that JavaTutor will help to usher in a new generation of tutorial systems for computer science education that adapt to individual students based not only on incoming student knowledge, but on a broad range of other student characteristics.},

However, most studies have concentrated on intra-group studies. We believe that computer supported collaborative learning tools can also aid software engineering students to have beneficial inter-group collaboration. In this research the communication patterns in three collaborative software engineering courses were analyzed with the method of social network analysis. It was found out that students do collaborate, but mostly along pre-established social connections. The main reason for this was the difficulty in matchmaking and discovering others who were struggling with the same problems. Our proposal is to study how students in similar learning scenarios benefit from computer supported collaborative tools that increase networking opportunities. The findings presented in this paper provide a baseline for comparison when performing social network analysis in future studies.},

abstract = {Motivation is a very important factor for successful instruction. This factor is especially relevant in collaborative learning contexts, where social interaction plays an important role. In this paper we present an evaluation of motivation in 139 students who were instructed under four pedagogical approaches: traditional lecture, collaborative learning, collaborative learning guided by CIF (an instructional framework for collaborative learning), and collaborative learning guided by CIF and supported by MoCAS (a collaborative learning tool). We considered the four dimensions of motivation according to self-determination theory. The statistical results show that, in global terms, students were more motivated by jointly using the collaborative instructional approach CIF and the MoCAS tool than by using a collaborative approach. Detailed analysis of the different kinds of motivation yields mixed results. Students who were instructed with CIF and especially those students instructed with CIF and MoCAS exhibited higher intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students instructed with CIF and MoCAS were the most extrinsically motivated via identified regulation. With respect to extrinsic motivation via external regulation, students instructed in a traditional, individual way were more motivated than students instructed collaboratively. Finally, high levels of amotivation were also associated to instruction using CIF and MoCAS. In summary, our results suggest that CIF and MoCAS are associated with high levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a finding that can aid in improving the learning processes, but they are also, unexpectedly, associated with amotivation, suggesting an overall increase in activation in the students who show mixed motivators.},

abstract = {Recently cardiac transplantation has an important place in treatment of end-stage cardiac failure. In Turkey between 2003 and 2005 at 10 centers 64 cardiac transplantations were performed including five at our facility. Herein we have presented our results. All patients were men of mean age 34.2 +/- 10.7 (17 to 44) years. Upon preoperative echocardiography their mean ejection fraction was 18{\%} +/- 3.27{\%} (17{\%} to 23{\%}). Pulmonary vascular resistance was 4.47 wood unit in one patient and in one case, there was Rh incompatibility between donor and recipient. We used HTK solution for protection of donor hearts. Mean ischemia time was 251.2 +/- 62.7 minutes (155 to 314). Mean aortic clamping time was 84 +/- 4.7 minutes (80 to 90). In all patients we performed a biatrial anastomosis technique. Hemofiltration was used to prevent hemodilution during operation. In the postoperative period four patients had acute renal dysfunction; one, a minor cerebrovascular accident; two, reoperated because of bleeding; one, cholestasis; one, temporary atrio-ventricular block; and one, mediastinitis. Mean follow-up time was 15.6 +/- 19.7 months (2 to 50). Neither early nor late mortality has occurred. All patients are in New York Heart Association class I. In all cases we used triple immunosuppressive therapy. In the follow-up period the mean number of cardiac biopsies per patient was 4.2 +/- 3.03 (2 to 8). Two cases had cardiac catheterization. As a complication of cardiac biopsy, pericardial tamponade developed in one patient; in another one we observed a right ventricular aneursym after cardiac biopsy. Cardiac transplantation was performed with low mortality and morbidity rates in end-stage cardiac failure patients with longer life expectancy and higher life quality. Unfortunately in our country, because of difficulties to find donor hearts, cardiac transplantations were small in number. For better results, we need a larger series.},

We have used a multiagent-based system to develop a CSCL application and multiagent-frameworks to form student groups that improve student collaborative learning.

abstract = {Traditional computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) systems focus primarily on facilitating group work amongst students, providing several different modes for different types of communication, from chatting applications to shared whiteboards. The power of a good CSCL system, in addition to the interactions it supports, lies with the data the system can gather from those interactions (both relational and content-based). Thus, we have developed the Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed System in Education (I-MINDS), a CSCL system built on the Microsoft ConferenceXP platform that tracks real-time data to support student learning and classroom management. I-MINDS facilitates (1) student-student interactions through message dialogs, stored as trees, and (2) student-teacher interactions through question/answer pairs. I-MINDS logs these interactions in a MySQL database. Our VirtualClass room analysis tool derives statistics from these interactions such as student responsiveness, degree of dialog involvement, amount of contribution, and quality of involvement and contribution. Then, an instructor can view overall,trends for individual students and groups and detailed charts for all statistics for each student or all students for each statistic, which is especially helpful in large classrooms and in distance education. The instructor can also adjust a "highlight" threshold for each statistic such that any value failing to meet the threshold will be highlighted for easy observation. Our DatabaseSearch analysis tool allows students and teachers to search through recorded interactions and filter the results based on metadata such as time interval, class relevance, or keyword content.},

The focus is threefold: 1) analyze critical design issues of AICLS systems and organize them under a unifying classification scheme, 2) present research evidence on the impact of these systems on student learning, and 3) identify current trends and open research questions in the field. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 105 articles were included in the review with 70 of them reporting concrete evaluation data on the learning impact of AICLS systems. Systems design analysis led us to propose a classification scheme with five dimensions: pedagogical objective, target of adaptation, modeling, technology, and design space. The reviewed articles indicate that AICLS systems increasingly introduce Artificial Intelligence and Web 2.0 techniques to support pretask interventions, in-task peer interactions, and learning domain-specific activities. Findings also suggest that AICLS systems may improve both learners' domain knowledge and collaboration skills. However, these benefits are subject to the learning design and the capability of AICLS to adapt and intervene in an unobtrusive way. Finally, providing peer interaction support seems to motivate students and improve collaboration and learning},

abstract = {Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a research field which emerged during the past 20 years. The research addressed questions in CSCL including-among others - how groups and individuals learn through peer interaction using specific tools, how small groups interact and develop shared meanings over time, how teachers orchestrate collaborative learning activities in the classroom with the support of technology, how institutions change and create new conditions for teaching and learning, and even how the opportunities for learning change as society adopts new models for education. Following the constructivistic and socio-cultural approaches in learning, numerous CSCL tools have been designed, developed and tested over the years. Although they can be classified in various ways, the distinction between systemic and dialogic types of tools and approaches is adopted in this paper. Following this categorization, four interesting research approaches, each focusing on a different kind of computer mediated tool are presented, designating the diversity of research within the CSCL field.

abstract = {Costs and benefits are recurrent issues that concern all the computing areas, including computer and software engineering. Mastery of optimization algorithms is essential in these fields, but their didactics hardly has received any attention. To fill this gap, the interactive system GreedEx was designed to support the active learning of greedy algorithms by means of experimentation. In this article we describe GreedExCol, a collaborative extension of GreedEx that complements its experimental phase with a discussion phase held by the students in each team. The contributions of the article are threefold. Firstly, we present GreedExCol, a CSCL system aimed at supporting collaborative discussion on experimental results of optimality for greedy algorithms. Secondly, GreedExCol was evaluated with respect to educational effectiveness, obtaining statistically significant improvements of the collaborative, experimental approach over an individual, experimental approach without the support of GreedExCol. Thirdly, GreedExCol was evaluated in the same two groups with respect to motivation, obtaining a statistically significant increase of implicit motivation for students in the experimental group. Overall, we present a medium-term effort for developing an innovative learning system and a comprehensive evaluation of its impact over the students. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {Social media technology has enabled virtual collaborative environments where people actively interact, share knowledge, coordinate activities, solve problems, co-create value, and innovate. Organizations have begun to leverage approaches and technologies to involve numerous people from outside their boundaries to perform organizational tasks. Despite the success and popularity of this 'crowdsourcing' phenomenon, there appears to be a distinct gap in the literature regarding the empirical evaluation of the factors involved in a crowdsourcing user experience. This paper aims to fill this void by proposing a theoretical model of the antecedents and their relationships for crowdsourcing user engagement. It is defined as the quality of effort online users devote to collaboration activities that contribute directly to desired outcomes. Drawing from research in psychology and IS, we identify three critical elements that precede crowdsourcing user engagement: personal interest in topic, goal clarity, and motivation to contribute. This paper examines the theoretical basis of these variables of interest in detail, derives a causal model of their interrelationships, and identifies future plans for model testing. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

abstract = {I-MINDS provides a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) infrastructure and environment for learners in synchronous learning and classroom management applications for instructors, for large classroom or distance education situations. For supporting the instructor, I-MINDS includes a teacher agent. The teacher agent allows the instructor to interact with students, manage Q{\&}A sessions, administer quizzes, post evaluations, form groups and monitor individual and group performances. For computer-supported collaborative learning, I-MINDS, which stands for Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed Systems in Education, provides a student agent for each student. Each student agent monitors and models its user and carries out group formation with other student agents behind-the-scene. I-MINDS provides standard online collaborative features such as chat rooms and whiteboards and implements a structured cooperative learning mechanism called Jigsaw. The system also incorporates multiagent coalition formation algorithms for forming peer groups. I-MINDS also provides a group agent for each peer group that monitors and evaluates its assigned peer group. I-MINDS has been deployed and evaluated in an introductory computer science course (CS1). Results show that intelligent tools such as I-MINDS can be used in a real-time environment to support student cooperative learning activities, and also as a testbed to collect instructional or pedagogical data for better understanding of student collaborative learning. This paper describes the I-MINDS framework, implementation, deployment, and test results comprehensively.},

The software and technology in such courses could benefit from the use of student models to inform and guide cus-tomized support tailored to the needs of individual students. In this paper, we investigate how student motivated engagement profiles developed in educational research can be used as such models to predict student behaviors. These models are advanta-geous over those learned directly from observing individual stu-dents, as they rely on different data that can be available a priori before students use the technology. Using tracked behaviors of 249 students from 7 CS1 courses over the span of 3 semesters, we discover that students with different engagement profiles indeed behave differently in an online, wiki-based CSCL system while performing collaborative creative thinking exercises, and the dif-ferences between students are primarily as expected based on the differences in the profiles. Thus, such profiles could be useful as student models for providing customized support in e-learning environments in CS1 courses.},

Abstract In computer-supported collaborative learning contexts, group formation is a key aspect, since different characteristics of students might influence the group performance. In this article, we present an intelligent assistant that models group formation as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem (WCSP). The assistant takes into account three students' features, namely: psychological styles, team roles and social networks. The proposed WCSP approach is able to combine constraints and preferences both for individuals and groups. The main goal of the assistant is to aid teachers to form learning groups considering factors such as team role balance and distribution of psychological styles. We also describe a pilot study to evaluate our proposal in different scenarios.},

This criterion is based on taking into account the team roles of the students and on forming well-balanced teams according to the team roles of their members. To analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm, we report the computational experiments developed on eight different data sets. In this respect, the algorithm has obtained high-quality solutions for each one of the utilized data sets. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},
