abstract = {Wikis today are being used as a tool to conduct collaborative writing assignments in classrooms. However, typical Wikis do not adequately address the assessment of individual student contributions toward their groups or provide any automated group formation mechanism. To improve these aspects, we have designed and implemented ClassroomWiki - a web-based collaborative Wiki writing tool. For the students, ClassroomWiki provides a web interface for writing and revising their group's Wiki and a topic-based forum for discussing their ideas during collaboration. When the students collaborate, ClassroomWiki tracks all student activities and builds detailed student models that represent their contributions toward their groups. For the teacher, ClassroomWiki provides a multiagent framework that uses the student models to form student groups to improve the collaborative learning of students. To investigate the impact of ClassroomWiki, we have conducted a three-week-long collaborative Wiki writing assignment in a university-level history course. The results suggest that ClassroomWiki can 1) improve the collaborative learning outcome of the students by its group formation framework, 2) help the teacher better assess a student's contribution toward his or her group and avoid free riding, and 3) facilitate specific and precise teacher intervention with accurate and detailed tracking of student activities.},

Learner models are now embedded in real world applications which can claim to have thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of users. Probabilistic models for skill assessment are playing a key role in these advanced learning environments. In this paper, we review the learner models that have played the largest roles in the success of these learning environments, and also the latest advances in the modeling and assessment of learner skills. We conclude by discussing related advancements in modeling other key constructs such as learner motivation, emotional and attentional state, meta-cognition and self-regulated learning, group learning, and the recent movement towards open and shared learner models.},

abstract = {This article offers a vision for technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning at scale. It begins with historical work in the area of tutorial dialogue systems. It traces the history of that area of the field of Artificial Intelligence in Education as it has made an impact on the field of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning through the creation of forms of dynamic support for collaborative learning, and makes an argument for the importance of advances in the field of Language Technologies for this work. In particular, this support has been enabled by an integration of text mining and conversational agents to form a novel type of micro-script support for productive discussion processes. This research from the early part of the century has paved the way for emerging technologies that support discussion-based learning at scale in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In the next 25 years, we expect to see this early, emerging work in MOOC contexts grow into ubiquitously available social learning approaches in free online learning environments like MOOCs, or what comes next in the online learning space. These ambitious social learning approaches include Problem Based Learning, Team Project Based Learning, and Collaborative Reflection. We expect to see the capability of drawing in and effectively supporting learners of all walks of life, especially impacting currently under-served learners. To that end, we describe the current exploratory efforts to deploy technology supported collaborative and discussion-based learning in MOOCs and offer a vision for work going forward into the next decade, where we envision learning communities and open collaborative work communities coming together as persistent technology supported and enhanced communities of practice.},

abstract = {Educational psychology findings indicate that active processing (such as self-testing) is more effective for learning than passive reading or even rereading. Electronic books (ebooks) can include much more than static pictures and text. Ebooks can promote better learning by increasing the reader's interaction with the material through multi-modal learning supports, worked examples, and low cognitive load practice activities. For example, multiple choice questions with immediate feedback can help identify misconceptions and gaps in knowledge. Parsons problems, which are mixed up code segments that have to be put in the correct order, require learners to think about the order of the statements in a solution without having to worry about syntax errors. Our research group has been applying concepts from educational psychology to make learning from ebooks more effective and efficient. This paper reports on an observational study and log file analysis on the use of an ebook that incorporates interactive activities. We provide evidence that learners engaged in the interactive activities, but used some types of activities more than others. We also found evidence that learners encountered some "desirable difficulties" which can improve learning. This descriptive study informs a research agenda to improve the quality of instruction in computing education.},

A quantitative analysis of logs showed that most students, and beginners especially, used the PVs, even where the PV did not directly affect their grade. Students commonly spent more time studying certain steps than others, suggesting they used the PVs attentively. Nevertheless, substantial numbers of students appeared to gloss over some key animation steps, something that future improvements to pedagogy may address. Overall, the results suggest that integrating PVs into an ebook can promote student engagement and has been fairly successful in the studied context. More research is needed to understand the differences between our results and earlier ones, and to assess the generalizability of our findings.},

abstract = {Introductory computer science courses cultivate the next generation of computer scientists. The impressions students take away from these courses are crucial, setting the tone for the rest of the students' computer science education. It is known that students struggle with many concepts central to computer science, struggles that could be alleviated in part through hands-on practice and individualized instruction. However, even the best existing instructional practices do not facilitate individualized hands-on support for students at large. We have built JavaTutor, an intelligent tutoring system for introductory computer science, which works alongside students to support them through both cognitive (skills and knowledge) and affective (emotion-based) feedback. JavaTutor aims to make advances in interactive, scalable student support. JavaTutor's behaviors were developed within a novel framework that leverages machine learning to acquire tutorial strategies from data collected within tutorial sessions between novice students and experienced human tutors. This demo presents an overview of the data-driven development of JavaTutor and shows how JavaTutor assesses and responds to students' contextualized needs. It is hoped that JavaTutor will help to usher in a new generation of tutorial systems for computer science education that adapt to individual students based not only on incoming student knowledge, but on a broad range of other student characteristics.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Software process improvement (SPI) has been around for decades: frameworks are proposed, success factors are studied, and experiences have been reported. However, the sheer mass of concepts, approaches, and standards published over the years overwhelms practitioners as well as researchers. What is out there? Are there new trends and emerging approaches? What are open issues? Still, we struggle to answer these questions about the current state of SPI and related research. In this article, we present results from an updated systematic mapping study to shed light on the field of SPI, to develop a big picture of the state of the art, and to draw conclusions for future research directions. An analysis of 769 publications draws a big picture of SPI-related research of the past quarter-century. Our study shows a high number of solution proposals, experience reports, and secondary studies, but only few theories and models on SPI in general. In particular, standard SPI models like CMMI and ISO/IEC 15,504 are analyzed, enhanced, and evaluated for applicability in practice, but these standards are also critically discussed, e.g., from the perspective of SPI in small-to-medium-sized companies, which leads to new specialized frameworks. New and specialized frameworks account for the majority of the contributions found (approx. 38{\%}). Furthermore, we find a growing interest in success factors (approx. 16{\%}) to aid companies in conducting SPI and in adapting agile principles and practices for SPI (approx. 10{\%}). Beyond these specific topics, the study results also show an increasing interest into secondary studies with the purpose of aggregating and structuring SPI-related knowledge. Finally, the present study helps directing future research by identifying under-researched topics awaiting further investigation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The Galaxy Project offers the popular web browser-based platform Galaxy for running bioinformatics tools and constructing simple workflows. Here, we present a broad collection of additional Galaxy tools for large scale analysis of gene and protein sequences. The motivating research theme is the identification of specific genes of interest in a range of non-model organisms, and our central example is the identification and prediction of "effector" proteins produced by plant pathogens in order to manipulate their host plant. This functional annotation of a pathogen's predicted capacity for virulence is a key step in translating sequence data into potential applications in plant pathology. This collection includes novel tools, and widely-used third-party tools such as NCBI BLAST+ wrapped for use within Galaxy. Individual bioinformatics software tools are typically available separately as standalone packages, or in online browser-based form. The Galaxy framework enables the user to combine these and other tools to automate organism scale analyses as workflows, without demanding familiarity with command line tools and scripting. Workflows created using Galaxy can be saved and are reusable, so may be distributed within and between research groups, facilitating the construction of a set of standardised, reusable bioinformatic protocols. The Galaxy tools and workflows described in this manuscript are open source and freely available from the Galaxy Tool Shed (http://usegalaxy.org/toolshed or http://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu).},

abstract = {Characterizing transcriptomes in non-model organisms has resulted in a massive increase in our understanding of biological phenomena. This boon, largely made possible via high-throughput sequencing, means that studies of functional, evolutionary, and population genomics are now being done by hundreds or even thousands of labs around the world. For many, these studies begin with a de novo transcriptome assembly, which is a technically complicated process involving several discrete steps. The Oyster River Protocol (ORP), described here, implements a standardized and benchmarked set of bioinformatic processes, resulting in an assembly with enhanced qualities over other standard assembly methods. Specifically, ORP produced assemblies have higher Detonate and TransRate scores and mapping rates, which is largely a product of the fact that it leverages a multi-assembler and kmer assembly process, thereby bypassing the shortcomings of any one approach. These improvements are important, as previously unassembled transcripts are included in ORP assemblies, resulting in a significant enhancement of the power of downstream analysis. Further, as part of this study, I show that assembly quality is unrelated with the number of reads generated, above 30 million reads.

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, decreases grain yield and quality in wheat and barley. Disease severity, deoxynivalenol (DON), fungal biomass, and transcript accumulation were examined in a wheat near-isogenic line pair carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele for the chromosome 3BS FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (Fhb1). Fhb1 restricts spread of disease symptoms but does not provide resistance to initial infection or initial DON accumulation. Wheat exhibits both induction and repression of large sets of gene transcripts during F. graminearum infection. In addition, a difference in the general timing of transcript accumulation in plants carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele at the Fhb1 locus was detected, and 14 wheat gene transcripts were detected that exhibited accumulation differences between the resistant and susceptible alleles. These results indicate that these may be host responses that differentiate the resistant from the susceptible interaction. Comparative analysis of the wheat-F. graminearum and the barley-F. graminearum interactions revealed a large set of conserved transcript accumulation patterns. However, we also detected gene transcripts that were repressed in wheat but not in barley. Based on the disease symptoms, transcript accumulation data, and comparative analysis of the barley and wheat host response to F. graminearum infection, we developed an integrated model for the interactions of wheat and barley with F. graminearum.},

abstract = {In recent years software has become integral part of our lives. From product software has become a service now. Software industry has undergone a shift in paradigm. Companies look into every aspect for effective project management. Practitioners have started considering human aspect equally important in the product, process, people triad. Human aspect has become top concern for companies' management since companies have realized that software is a product which is completely people driven. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the data mining area, where the objective is the discovery of knowledge that is correct and of high benefit for management. In this paper, we propose a model for high capability performance . This approach has proven to have positive impact on software development. It is a experimental and empirically driven model that builds a project team capability to achieve the desired software quality within the time and cost constraints. It is integration of personnel capability and post training. The capability and training are co-supportive and work in conjunction to ensure project success.},

abstract = {Source control repositories, bug repositories, archived communications, deployment logs, and code repositories are examples of software repositories that are commonly available for most software projects. The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field. {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly dependent on third-party libraries. It is widely recognized that using mature and well-tested third-party libraries can improve developers' productivity, reduce time-to-market, and produce more reliable software. Today's open-source repositories provide a wide range of libraries that can be freely downloaded and used. However, as software libraries are documented separately but intended to be used together, developers are unlikely to fully take advantage of these reuse opportunities. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically identify third-party library usage patterns, i.e., collections of libraries that are commonly used together by developers. Our approach employs a hierarchical clustering technique to group together software libraries based on external client usage. To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6000 popular libraries from Maven Central Repository and investigated their usage by over 38,000 client systems from the Github repository. Our experiments show that our technique is able to detect the majority (77{\%}) of highly consistent and cohesive library usage patterns across a considerable number of client systems.},

However, most studies have concentrated on intra-group studies. We believe that computer supported collaborative learning tools can also aid software engineering students to have beneficial inter-group collaboration. In this research the communication patterns in three collaborative software engineering courses were analyzed with the method of social network analysis. It was found out that students do collaborate, but mostly along pre-established social connections. The main reason for this was the difficulty in matchmaking and discovering others who were struggling with the same problems. Our proposal is to study how students in similar learning scenarios benefit from computer supported collaborative tools that increase networking opportunities. The findings presented in this paper provide a baseline for comparison when performing social network analysis in future studies.},

abstract = {Motivation is a very important factor for successful instruction. This factor is especially relevant in collaborative learning contexts, where social interaction plays an important role. In this paper we present an evaluation of motivation in 139 students who were instructed under four pedagogical approaches: traditional lecture, collaborative learning, collaborative learning guided by CIF (an instructional framework for collaborative learning), and collaborative learning guided by CIF and supported by MoCAS (a collaborative learning tool). We considered the four dimensions of motivation according to self-determination theory. The statistical results show that, in global terms, students were more motivated by jointly using the collaborative instructional approach CIF and the MoCAS tool than by using a collaborative approach. Detailed analysis of the different kinds of motivation yields mixed results. Students who were instructed with CIF and especially those students instructed with CIF and MoCAS exhibited higher intrinsic motivation. Furthermore, students instructed with CIF and MoCAS were the most extrinsically motivated via identified regulation. With respect to extrinsic motivation via external regulation, students instructed in a traditional, individual way were more motivated than students instructed collaboratively. Finally, high levels of amotivation were also associated to instruction using CIF and MoCAS. In summary, our results suggest that CIF and MoCAS are associated with high levels of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, a finding that can aid in improving the learning processes, but they are also, unexpectedly, associated with amotivation, suggesting an overall increase in activation in the students who show mixed motivators.},

In Turkey between 2003 and 2005 at 10 centers 64 cardiac transplantations were performed including five at our facility. Herein we have presented our results. All patients were men of mean age 34.2 +/- 10.7 (17 to 44) years. Upon preoperative echocardiography their mean ejection fraction was 18{\%} +/- 3.27{\%} (17{\%} to 23{\%}). Pulmonary vascular resistance was 4.47 wood unit in one patient and in one case, there was Rh incompatibility between donor and recipient. We used HTK solution for protection of donor hearts. Mean ischemia time was 251.2 +/- 62.7 minutes (155 to 314). Mean aortic clamping time was 84 +/- 4.7 minutes (80 to 90). In all patients we performed a biatrial anastomosis technique. Hemofiltration was used to prevent hemodilution during operation. In the postoperative period four patients had acute renal dysfunction; one, a minor cerebrovascular accident; two, reoperated because of bleeding; one, cholestasis; one, temporary atrio-ventricular block; and one, mediastinitis. Mean follow-up time was 15.6 +/- 19.7 months (2 to 50). Neither early nor late mortality has occurred. All patients are in New York Heart Association class I. In all cases we used triple immunosuppressive therapy. In the follow-up period the mean number of cardiac biopsies per patient was 4.2 +/- 3.03 (2 to 8). Two cases had cardiac catheterization. As a complication of cardiac biopsy, pericardial tamponade developed in one patient; in another one we observed a right ventricular aneursym after cardiac biopsy. Cardiac transplantation was performed with low mortality and morbidity rates in end-stage cardiac failure patients with longer life expectancy and higher life quality. Unfortunately in our country, because of difficulties to find donor hearts, cardiac transplantations were small in number. For better results, we need a larger series.},

The system, called I-MINDS, has a host of intelligent agents for each classroom: a teacher agent ranks and categorizes real-time questions from the students and collects statistics on student participation, a number of group agents that each maintains a collaborative group and facilitate student discussions, and a student agent for each student that profiles a student and finds compatible students to form the student's "buddy group". Each agent is capable of machine learning, thus improving its performance and services over time. These agents also interact and collaborate among themselves to exchange information and form coalitions dynamically to better serve the users. We have pilot-tested I-MINDS in GIS lectures, deployed I-MINDS in an introductory computer science course (CS1) 's laboratory, and evaluated the impact of I-MINDS based on student assessment.

However, adopting such a CSCL tool in a classroom still requires the teacher to develop (or decide on which to adopt) the CSCL tool and the CSCL script, design the relevant pedagogical aspects (i.e., the learning objectives, assessment method, etc.) to overcome the associated challenges (e.g., free riding, student assessment, forming student groups that improve student learning, etc). We have used a multiagent-based system to develop a CSCL application and multiagent-frameworks to form student groups that improve student collaborative learning. In this paper, we describe the contexts of our three generations of CSCL applications (i.e., I-MINDS and ClassroomWiki) and provide a set of lessons learned from our deployments in terms of the script, tool, and pedagogical aspects of using CSCL. We believe that our lessons would allow 1) the instructors and students to use intelligent CSCL applications more effectively and efficiently, and help to improve the design of such systems, and 2) the researchers to gain additional insights into the impact of collaborative learning theories when they are applied to real-world classrooms.},

abstract = {Traditional computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) systems focus primarily on facilitating group work amongst students, providing several different modes for different types of communication, from chatting applications to shared whiteboards. The power of a good CSCL system, in addition to the interactions it supports, lies with the data the system can gather from those interactions (both relational and content-based). Thus, we have developed the Intelligent Multiagent Infrastructure for Distributed System in Education (I-MINDS), a CSCL system built on the Microsoft ConferenceXP platform that tracks real-time data to support student learning and classroom management. I-MINDS facilitates (1) student-student interactions through message dialogs, stored as trees, and (2) student-teacher interactions through question/answer pairs. I-MINDS logs these interactions in a MySQL database. Our VirtualClass room analysis tool derives statistics from these interactions such as student responsiveness, degree of dialog involvement, amount of contribution, and quality of involvement and contribution. Then, an instructor can view overall,trends for individual students and groups and detailed charts for all statistics for each student or all students for each statistic, which is especially helpful in large classrooms and in distance education. The instructor can also adjust a "highlight" threshold for each statistic such that any value failing to meet the threshold will be highlighted for easy observation. Our DatabaseSearch analysis tool allows students and teachers to search through recorded interactions and filter the results based on metadata such as time interval, class relevance, or keyword content.},

The focus is threefold: 1) analyze critical design issues of AICLS systems and organize them under a unifying classification scheme, 2) present research evidence on the impact of these systems on student learning, and 3) identify current trends and open research questions in the field. After systematically searching online bibliographic databases, 105 articles were included in the review with 70 of them reporting concrete evaluation data on the learning impact of AICLS systems. Systems design analysis led us to propose a classification scheme with five dimensions: pedagogical objective, target of adaptation, modeling, technology, and design space. The reviewed articles indicate that AICLS systems increasingly introduce Artificial Intelligence and Web 2.0 techniques to support pretask interventions, in-task peer interactions, and learning domain-specific activities. Findings also suggest that AICLS systems may improve both learners' domain knowledge and collaboration skills. However, these benefits are subject to the learning design and the capability of AICLS to adapt and intervene in an unobtrusive way. Finally, providing peer interaction support seems to motivate students and improve collaboration and learning},

abstract = {Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) is a research field which emerged during the past 20 years. The research addressed questions in CSCL including-among others - how groups and individuals learn through peer interaction using specific tools, how small groups interact and develop shared meanings over time, how teachers orchestrate collaborative learning activities in the classroom with the support of technology, how institutions change and create new conditions for teaching and learning, and even how the opportunities for learning change as society adopts new models for education. Following the constructivistic and socio-cultural approaches in learning, numerous CSCL tools have been designed, developed and tested over the years. Although they can be classified in various ways, the distinction between systemic and dialogic types of tools and approaches is adopted in this paper. Following this categorization, four interesting research approaches, each focusing on a different kind of computer mediated tool are presented, designating the diversity of research within the CSCL field.

abstract = {Costs and benefits are recurrent issues that concern all the computing areas, including computer and software engineering. Mastery of optimization algorithms is essential in these fields, but their didactics hardly has received any attention. To fill this gap, the interactive system GreedEx was designed to support the active learning of greedy algorithms by means of experimentation. In this article we describe GreedExCol, a collaborative extension of GreedEx that complements its experimental phase with a discussion phase held by the students in each team. The contributions of the article are threefold. Firstly, we present GreedExCol, a CSCL system aimed at supporting collaborative discussion on experimental results of optimality for greedy algorithms. Secondly, GreedExCol was evaluated with respect to educational effectiveness, obtaining statistically significant improvements of the collaborative, experimental approach over an individual, experimental approach without the support of GreedExCol. Thirdly, GreedExCol was evaluated in the same two groups with respect to motivation, obtaining a statistically significant increase of implicit motivation for students in the experimental group. Overall, we present a medium-term effort for developing an innovative learning system and a comprehensive evaluation of its impact over the students. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract = {The problem of assigning learners to groups is essential in collaborative venture like group peer mentorship. Usually, in group peer mentorship, the group of peers is focused on one topic or question, and engage in discussion, argumentation, and providing criticism and constructive feedback, related to the individual contributions made by the participants. Therefore, the problem here is how to group peers that provide feedback to each other to ensure that all peers benefit from the venture, and everybody has something to offer. This problem is akin to the group formation problem in the area of computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). Many group formation algorithms exist in the area of CSCL, but they have problem with limited and fixed constraints, evaluation strategies, their initial grouping mechanism and the goal of the grouping strategy. Therefore, we proposed a grouping algorithm based on some constraints and the principles of the Hungarian algorithm, to achieve a diversified grouping of peers for every mentorship session. Although this algorithm had been used manually in some of our previous small scale studies, in this paper, we evaluated the algorithm using 1080 system generated data, and compared the performance of our algorithm with three other algorithms in CSCL. {\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract = {Social media technology has enabled virtual collaborative environments where people actively interact, share knowledge, coordinate activities, solve problems, co-create value, and innovate. Organizations have begun to leverage approaches and technologies to involve numerous people from outside their boundaries to perform organizational tasks. Despite the success and popularity of this 'crowdsourcing' phenomenon, there appears to be a distinct gap in the literature regarding the empirical evaluation of the factors involved in a crowdsourcing user experience. This paper aims to fill this void by proposing a theoretical model of the antecedents and their relationships for crowdsourcing user engagement. It is defined as the quality of effort online users devote to collaboration activities that contribute directly to desired outcomes. Drawing from research in psychology and IS, we identify three critical elements that precede crowdsourcing user engagement: personal interest in topic, goal clarity, and motivation to contribute. This paper examines the theoretical basis of these variables of interest in detail, derives a causal model of their interrelationships, and identifies future plans for model testing. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2013.},

They have been accused of sweeping up massive amounts of information without evidence of the technologies being effective in improving security. The view of critics is clear, but what do intelligence officials themselves say? This paper analyzes statements of intelligence officials in the U.S. and U.K. from 2006 to 2016, examines what criteria officials use in their discourse on effectiveness, and investigates how considerations of cost and proportionality factor into the equation. It identifies seven measures of effectiveness in the statements of intelligence officials, and finds that cost, though rarely discussed, is the driver behind formalized evaluations of surveillance programs.},

abstract = {Motivation:While deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision and other fields, currently it does not work well on genomic data due to "big p, small n" problem (i.e., relatively small number of samples with high-dimensional features). In order to make deep learning work with a small amount of training data, we have to design new models that can facilitate few-shot learning. In this paper we focus on developing data efficient deep learning models that learn from a limited number of training examples and generalize well. Results: We developed two deep learningmodules: feature attention layer and k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) attention poolinglayer tomake ourmodelmuchmore data efficient than conventionaldeep learningmodels. Feature attention layer can directly select important features that are useful for patient classification. kNN attention pooling layer is based on graph attention model, and is good for semi-supervised few-shot learning. Experiments on both synthetic data and cancer genomic data from TCGA projects show that our method has better generalization power than conventional neural network model. Availability: We have implemented our method using PyTorch deep learning framework (https://pytorch.org). The code is freely available at https://github.com/BeautyOfWeb/AffinityNet.},

The technique does not require the user to memorize abbreviations and provides incremental feedback of the most likely completions.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Taimur Bakhshi. Emerging network services and subsequent growth in the networking infrastructure have gained tremendousmomentumin recent years. Application performance requiring rapid real-time network provisioning, optimized traffic management, and virtualization of shared resources has induced the conceptualization and adoption of new networking models. Software defined networking (SDN), one of the predominant and relatively new networking paradigms, seeks to simplify network management by decoupling network control logic from the underlying hardware and introduces real-time network programmability enabling innovation. The present work reviews the state of the art in software defined networking providing a historical perspective on complementary technologies in network programmability and the inherent shortcomings which paved the way for SDN. The SDN architecture is discussed along with popular protocols, platforms, and existing simulation and debugging solutions. Furthermore, a detailed analysis is presented around recent SDN development and deployment avenues ranging from mobile communications and data centers to campus networks and residential environments.

abstract = {Social applications on the web let users track and follow the activities of a large number of others regardless of location or affiliation. There is a potential for this transparency to radically improve collaboration and learning in complex knowledge-based activities. Based on a series of in-depth interviews with central and peripheral GitHub users, we examined the value of transparency for large-scale distributed collaborations and communities of practice. We find that people make a surprisingly rich set of social inferences from the networked activity information in GitHub, such as inferring someone else's technical goals and vision when they edit code, or guessing which of several similar projects has the best chance of thriving in the long term. Users combine these inferences into effective strategies for coordinating work, advancing technical skills and managing their reputation. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM.},

abstract = {Problem-solving tasks are classified on the basis of four task characteristics (ambiguity, number of solutions, complexity, and experience), three process categories (preparation, production, and evaluation), and four general outcome categories (number of solutions, time to solution, quality, and process measures). The classification scheme is compared with recent attempts to define "ideal" characteristics of measures, and seven general criteria are proposed for evaluating problem-solving tasks. Twelve categories of tasks commonly used in research are classified and evaluated. Concept identification, switchlight problems, verbal mazes, and simulations are concluded to be tasks that most closely satisfy all evaluation criteria, although each has some problems. Implications for improvement of measures of problem-solving are indicated. {\textcopyright} 1976.},

abstract = {Deficiencies in engineering education have been exhaustively enumerated in recent years. Engineering schools and professors have been told by countless panels and blue-ribbon commissions and, in the United States, by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology that we must strengthen our coverage of fundamentals; teach more about " real-world " engineering design and operations, including quality management; cover more material in frontier areas of engineering; offer more and better instruction in both oral and written communication skills and teamwork skills; provide training in critical and creative thinking skills and problem-solving methods; produce graduates who are conversant with engineering ethics and the connections between technology and society; and reduce the number of hours in the engineering curriculum so that the average student can complete it in four years. 1 This is an impressive wish list—especially when the last item is included—that cannot possibly be fulfilled using the approach to educating engineers that has predominated in the past 50 years. If, for example, courses continue to be confined to single subjects (heat transfer in one course, thermodynamics in another, environmental engineering in another, technical writing in another, etc.) it will take a six-or seven-year curriculum to produce engineers who have the desired proficiency in the fundamentals and are conversant with methods of modern engineering practice, culturally literate, and skilled in communication. Moreover, if students are assigned only well-defined convergent problems, they will never gain the skills needed to tackle and solve challenging multidisciplinary problems that call for critical judgment and creativity. Finally, even if nothing new is added to the existing curriculum, confining it to four years will be almost impossible unless more efficient and effective ways to cover the material can be found. The reality is that better teaching methods exist. The literature in general education, technical education, and educational psychology is replete with methods that have been shown to facilitate learning more effectively than the traditional single-discipline lecturing approach. Unfortunately, these developments have so far had relatively little impact on mainstream engineering education. Although their content has changed in some ways and the students use calculators and computers instead of slide rules, many engineering classes in 1999 are taught in exactly the same way that engineering classes in 1959 were taught.},

abstract = {Educational games constitute an important mean of delivering effective learning procedures to students and they can offer various learning opportunities in all levels of education. In this work, we present a collaborative game that was developed to assist students in learning algorithms and we explore its learning capabilities. The game aims to assist students in learning constraint satisfaction algorithms and it is based on the map coloring game. In the context of the game, students can experiment and apply the algorithms in various learning activities and training scenarios. The game has been integrated into the curriculum of the artificial intelligence course in our university. An evaluation study was conducted in real classroom conditions and revealed quite promising results which indicate that the game is an effective way to enhance students' motivation, engagement and interest and also it helps students to deeper understand the functionality of constraint satisfaction algorithms.},

Dentro de un contexto muy amplio (relacionado directamente con la expresi{\'{o}}n anglosajona Computer Science que podr{\'{i}}a traducirse en espa{\~{n}}ol por Inform{\'{a}}tica), abarca un gran n{\'{u}}mero de {\'{a}}reas tem{\'{a}}ticas relacionadas con la computaci{\'{o}}n, tanto en su vertiente m{\'{a}}s cient{\'{i}}fica como en aquella propia de las ramas de la ingenier{\'{i}}a. Tratar de definir una materia puede suponer una tarea cuando menos complicada, pues siempre ser{\'{a}} dif{\'{i}}cil delimitarla, pudiendo surgir, ideas y opiniones contradictorias a este respecto. Por ello, quiz{\'{a}}s, la historia pueda ser el mejor medio para conseguirlo, por lo que, a continuaci{\'{o}}n, se va a hacer una breve revisi{\'{o}}n hist{\'{o}}rica de la Inform{\'{a}}tica.

@techreport{Berleur2010,
abstract = {Governments, the media, the information technology industry and scientists publicly argue that information and communication technologies (ICT) will bring about an inevitable transition from "industrial" to "information" or "knowledge-based" economies and societies. It is assumed that all aspects of our economic and social lives, in both the public and private spheres, will be radically different from what they are today. The World Summit on the Information Society (Geneva 2003 - Tunis 2005) shows the importance of a worldwide reflection on those topics. Perspectives and Policies on ICT in Society explores the ICT policies of different nations and regions such as Africa, China, Europe, and India. The authors assess the arguments surrounding the impending new age, as well as some of the more sensitive issues of its developments. This progress will signal an expansion of ICT in many domains - the so-called ubiquity - such as in the workplace, the home, government, and education and it will affect privacy and professional ethics. The expansion will also encompass all parts of the earth, particularly developing countries. Such growth must take place in the context of historical dimensions and should underscore the accountability of professionals in the field.The intent of this book is to address these issues and to serve as a handbook of IFIP's TC9 "Computers and Society" committee. Thirty authors from twelve countries consider the ICT policies with their associated perspectives and they explore what may be the information age and the digital society of tomorrow. The book provides reflection on today's complex society and addresses the uncertain developments rising from an increasingly global and technologically connected world.Jacques Berleur is at the University of Namur, Belgium, and Chrisanthi Avgerou at the London School of Economics, United Kingdom.},
