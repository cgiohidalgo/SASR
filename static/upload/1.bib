abstract = {En un entorno virtual de aprendizaje, el retorno
(feedback) por parte del profesor de las actividades de
evaluaci{\'{o}}n continua resulta imprescindible. As{\'{i}} pues,
el desarrollo de un sistema de retorno que sea {\'{u}}til al
estudiante y sostenible para el profesorado es un
aspecto cr{\'{i}}tico del dise{\~{n}}o de las asignaturas. En este
art{\'{i}}culo, se describe un sistema de retorno personalizado
basado en la evaluaci{\'{o}}n de las competencias y
objetivos espec{\'{i}}ficos de las asignaturas que se ha
aplicado a un entorno virtual y que es extensible a un
entorno presencial. El sistema dise{\~{n}}ado se ha probado
en las dos asignaturas de primer curso de los grados
de Ingenier{\'{i}}a Inform{\'{a}}tica (GEI) y de Tecnolog{\'{i}}as de
Telecomunicaci{\'{o}}n (GTT) con mayor n{\'{u}}mero de

abstract = {Scaffolding learners, i.e. helping learners to attain tasks they could not accomplish without support, entails the notion of fading, i.e. reducing the scaffolding for learners to become more and more self-regulated. Fading implies to tailor support for collaboration, such as collaboration scripts, to the particular needs of the specific collaborators. In computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) settings, support can be designed in a very restrictive and inflexible fashion; at the same time computerized settings open new possibilities for the realization of adaptive support as they enable automation of analysis and feedback mechanisms. In this symposium we present new technical approaches and latest empirical research on possibilities and limitations of adaptive support for learners in CSCL settings.},

abstract = {The emergence of new technologies such as three-dimensional virtual worlds brings new opportunities for teaching and learning. We conducted an action research approach to the analysis of how teaching and learning of computer programming at the university level could be developed within the Second Life virtual world. Results support the notion that it is possible to use this environment for better effectiveness in the learning of programming. The main results are the identification of problems hampering the teacher's intervention in this virtual world and the detection of solutions for those problems that were found effective to the success in using this environment for teaching/learning computer programming.},

abstract = {Collaborative learning environments provide a set of tools for students acting in groups to interact and accomplish an assigned task. In this kind of systems, students are free to express and communicate with each other, which usually lead to collaboration and communication problems that may require the intervention of a teacher. In this article, we introduce an intelligent agent approach to assist teachers through monitoring participations made by students within a collaborative distance learning environment, detecting conflictive situations in which a teacher's intervention may be necessary. High precision rates achieved on conflict detection scenarios suggest great potential for the application of the proposed rule-based approach for providing personalized assistance to teachers during the development of group works. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Educational data mining is an emerging discipline, concerned with developing methods for exploring the unique types of data that come from the educational context. This work is a survey of the specific application of data mining in learning management systems and a case study tutorial with the Moodle system. Our objective is to introduce it both theoretically and practically to all users interested in this new research area, and in particular to online instructors and e-learning administrators. We describe the full process for mining e-learning data step by step as well as how to apply the main data mining techniques used, such as statistics, visualization, classification, clustering and association rule mining of Moodle data. We have used free data mining tools so that any user can immediately begin to apply data mining without having to purchase a commercial tool or program a specific personalized tool. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
