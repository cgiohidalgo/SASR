Es previsible que la brecha en el suministro de energ\u00eda el\u00e9ctrica a trav\u00e9s de la extensi\u00f3n del Sistema Interconectado Nacional (SIN) tarde algunos a\u00f1os (si no d\u00e9cadas) para materializarse, y que garantice una cobertura total. Es por ello que las tecnolog\u00edas energ\u00e9ticas comerciales actuales deben ser sostenibles en el suministro de energ\u00eda a lo largo del tiempo; y quiz\u00e1s estas ayuden a disminuir la brecha para suplir las necesidades b\u00e1sicas humanas insatisfechas (REN21, GSR, 2016).",

Therefore local water potential would seem a better alternative to supply electricity. This paper is an investigation into all the issues concerning finding suitable sites for micro hydropower plants in remote areas in Lorestan province in Iran. Therefore, the basins, river network, and rural electricity condition in the province were studied. Then, we came up with a list of locations which would lend themselves best to the installation of micro hydropower plants in accordance to the existing parameters. Finally, an estimation of optimum nominal capacity for each micro hydropower was studied and related economic concerns were discussed.",

    "abstract": "The inherent technical, economic and environmental benefits of hydroelectric power make it an important contributor to the future world energy mix, particularly in the developing countries. These countries have a great and ever-intensifying need for power and water supplies and they also have the greatest remaining hydro potential. Development is a basic human right, as few would deny. Energy policymakers must meet their responsibility in exploring the most rational options for meeting the energy needs of the developing countries, while protecting the environment to the maximum possible extent. Technically, feasible hydropower estimated at nearly 15,000 TWh/yr still exists in the world today, mostly in countries where increased power supplies from clean and renewable sources are most urgently needed to progress social and economic development. This paper reviews the current role hydropower is playing in the world, along with some its inherent benefits, and then looks at the remaining potential, and some specific development plans in various countries of the world.",

    "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy, especially from renewable and sustainable sources, spurs the development of small hydropower plants and encourages investment in new survey studies. Preliminary hydropower survey studies usually carry huge uncertainties about the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of the undeveloped potential. This paper presents a methodology for large-scale survey of hydropower potential sites to be applied in the inception phase of hydroelectric development planning. The sequence of procedures to identify hydropower sites is based on remote sensing and regional streamflow data and was automated within a GIS-based computational program: Hydrospot. The program allows spotting more potential sites along the drainage network than it would be possible in a traditional survey study, providing different types of dam-powerhouse layouts and two types (operating modes) of projects: run-of-the-river and storage projects. Preliminary results from its applications in a hydropower-developed basin in Brazil have shown Hydrospot\u2019s limitations and potentialities in giving support to the mid-to-long-term planning of the electricity sector.",

In order to cope with these problems, this study proposes a new method to select feasible sites of small run-of-river hydropower projects by using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology. A combination of engineering, economic, and environmental criteria, as well as social impact is employed in this study. The selected study area is the upper Nan river basin situated in the north of Thailand. For the engineering criteria, the project locations are found by GIS in visual basic platform, and then economic evaluations of the selected projects are performed. Next, the environmental parameters are used to rank the projects by total weighted scores. Finally, a social impact study at the potential sites is conducted based on the public participation process, i.e. questionnaire survey and focus group discussions. The applicability of the proposed method is verified by the results of site selection of the small hydropower projects located on the Nan river basin in Thailand. This case study can be the model for the process of site selection of similar projects.",

An economic analysis is then run upon engineering selected alternatives to assess their economic feasibility. For a case study, this methodology is applied for Sefidbarg basin in Nokhan area nearby the Kermanshah province. Nokhan area is a mountainous district with steep and durable rivers. Finally, four alternatives are suggested for hydropower plant location on Sefidbarg basin considering engineering criteria. Economic parameters are then calculated for these suggested hydropower plants to assess their economic feasibility and rank them according to their economy. This procedure is able to quickly survey vast areas for spotting best location for hydropower plant.",

    "abstract": "The recent global energy crisis has provoked a need to explore alternate energy sources including run-of-the-river hydropower projects. To derive maximum payback for a given investment, finding the most advantageous siting of power plants is imperative. If a selection of potential sites misses some of the apparently indistinct sites with significant power potential, there is a chance of acquiring only partial benefits out of these investments. A review of the existing methods for evaluating power potential of a river is discussed in this paper with their limitations along with a new proposed approach. The new approach can be used to evaluate different installation schemes along a river to assess run-of-the-river hydropower potentials using geospatial data techniques to select sites exhibiting higher total hydropower potential. The case study of Kunhar River, located in the northern part of Pakistan, presents the applicability of the approach. Open source Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission (ASTER)\u2019s digital elevation model (DEM) and regional hydrologic gauged data are used for identifying the best locations for hydropower plants, demonstrating this approach is substantially more cost effective and robust compared to other field based assessment. Replicating the proposed approach for other locations is easy following the step-by-step method presented in this paper and giving consideration to the limitations described. This study may provide guidelines for the development of cost-effective and energy efficient hydropower projects. The use of this approach is most advantageous in the preliminary assessment phase of a project to narrow the scope of the detailed study focusing only on the higher potential sites.",

    "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to the socio-economic development of the Brazilian Amazon is the lack of electric energy in the numerous small isolated communities of the region that hampers value-added agricultural production, revenue growth and creation of jobs. One way to solve this problem is by setting up micro-hydro power (MHP) plants under a sustainable development perspective. This paper presents a decision support system (DSS) that analyzes this solution. The system considers the hydrological, topographical, geotechnical, environmental, energy, economic and social aspects of the target site. A detailed analysis is made of the hydrological model that employs a rainfall run-off model for small catchment analysis; the energy planning favors a two-turbine method to determine the maximum energy production during demand peaks, and the economic aspects show that the costs of energy generated by MHP plants are comparable to those from rural grid systems and lower than those from from diesel generators. Thus, the use of the hydro-power resources of the small catchments of Amazonia combined with the minimization of the environmental impacts caused by MHP not only fulfills the energy demand of the small communities of region, but is also viable economically along with job creation and revenue generation, and it supports the perspective of sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "ResumenLas centrales hidroel\u00e9ctricas son una fuente de energ\u00eda renovable respetuosa con el medio ambiente, pero, debido a las incertidumbres en los patrones de flujo, a menudo estos proyectos de generaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda fallan. Adem\u00e1s, las deliberaciones de personas desplazadas y activistas ambientales (debido a las perturbaciones a gran escala de los ecosistemas naturales de las \u00e1reas adyacentes) hacen que algunos proyectos hidroel\u00e9ctricos altamente eficientes no sean factibles. Es por eso que el \u00e9xito de los proyectos hidroel\u00e9ctricos depende en gran medida de la selecci\u00f3n de la ubicaci\u00f3n. Actualmente, la eficiencia en la selecci\u00f3n de las ubicaciones ideales depende principalmente de la opini\u00f3n de expertos o de los modelos lineales y otras metodolog\u00edas de toma de decisiones en las que el juicio y la opini\u00f3n humanos desempe\u00f1an un papel importante en la fiabilidad de la selecci\u00f3n. Pero, como de costumbre, la tasa de error en tales procedimientos es generalmente insatisfactoria. El presente estudio trata de aplicar algoritmos de agrupaci\u00f3n para identificar ubicaciones ideales para peque\u00f1as centrales hidroel\u00e9ctricas de tal manera que se pueda reducir la necesidad de expertos u opiniones. En la agrupaci\u00f3n de una ubicaci\u00f3n hidroel\u00e9ctrica adecuada, el comportamiento de forrajeo alimentario de los murci\u00e9lagos y la teor\u00eda de la maximizaci\u00f3n basada en la l\u00f3gica difusa se aplicaron a una poblaci\u00f3n de muestra de ubicaciones disponibles para la generaci\u00f3n de energ\u00eda hidroel\u00e9ctrica, incluida una en la que ya se hab\u00eda instalado una planta hidroel\u00e9ctrica y estaba funcionando. a la capacidad nominal. La eficiencia del algoritmo para identificar esta ubicaci\u00f3n se analiz\u00f3 para determinar la idoneidad de los algoritmos para estimar la ubicaci\u00f3n ideal para las centrales hidroel\u00e9ctricas. Los resultados mostraron que ambos enfoques pudieron identificar la ubicaci\u00f3n m\u00e1s adecuada, pero cuando se tom\u00f3 en cuenta el tiempo necesario para realizar la identificaci\u00f3n,",

    "abstract": "This paper reviews and compares software tools for the planning and design of small hydropower (SHP) plants. The main emphasis is on small scale hydropower resource assessment computer tools and methodologies for the development of SHP plants corresponding to a preliminary or prefeasibility study level. The paper presents a brief evaluation of the historic software tools and the current tools used in the small hydro industry. The reviewed tools vary from simple initial estimates to quite sophisticated software. The integration of assessment tools into Geographic Information System (GIS) environments has led to a leap forward in the strengthening of the evaluation of the power potential of water streams in the case of the spatial variability of different factors affecting stream power. A number of countries (e.g., Canada, Italy, Norway, Scotland and the US) have re-assessed their hydropower capacities based on spatial information of their water stream catchments, developing tools for automated hydro-site identification and deploying GIS-based tools, so-called Atlases, of small-scale hydropower resources on the Internet. However, a reliable assessment of real SHP site feasibility implies some \u201con the ground\u201d surveying, but this traditional assessment can be greatly facilitated using GIS techniques that involve the spatial variability of catchment characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Rural electrification in developing countries is often hampered by major information gaps between local communities and urban centers, where technical expertise and funding are concentrated. The tool presented in this paper addresses these gaps to support the implementation of off-grid micro hydropower infrastructure. Specifically, we present a method to site, size and evaluate the potential for micro hydropower based on remote sensing data. The method improves on previous approaches by (i) incorporating the effect of hillslope topography on the optimal layout of the infrastructure, and (ii) accounting for the constraints imposed by streamflow variability and local electricity demand on the optimal size of the plants. An assessment of the method\u2019s performance against 148 existing schemes indicates that it correctly identifies the most promising locations for hydropower in Nepal, but does not generally reproduce the specific design features of constructed plants, which are affected by site-specific constraints. We develop a proof-of-concept computer tool to explore the potential of webGIS technology to account for these constraints by collecting site-specific information from local users.",

    "abstract": "Pumped hydroelectric energy storage (PHES) is the largest and most mature form of energy storage currently available. However, the capital costs required for PHES are extremely large and the availability of suitable sites is decreasing. Therefore, identifying the remaining sites available for PHES is becoming vital so that the most beneficial location is chosen: in terms of capacity and economics. As a result, the aim of this work is to develop a computer program that will scan a terrain and identify if there are any feasible PHES sites on it. In this paper, a brief description of the program is provided, including the limitations identified during the initial development. Also, the program was used to evaluate a 20km \u00d7 40km area in the South West of Ireland so the results obtained from this study are discussed. Finally, future improvements to advance the program's capabilities are identified. The program has proven to date that it can identify feasible locations for PHES, however, further investigation is necessary to improve the site selection.",

On the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, the number of mobile sensors greatly increases and their locations are becoming more important. IoT services may not be fully supported when only considering the temporal feature of streaming data. Accordingly, stream processing should be performed with consideration into both temporal and spatial factors. However, existing researches have a limitation of processing spatial queries since they focus on the temporal processing of streaming data. To support spatiotemporal query processing on semantic data streams, we propose a query language, which integrates temporal and geospatial properties. Specifically, we construct a spatiotemporal index to process the proposed spatiotemporal query language efficiently. The experimental results with a prototype implementation show that the proposed method processes spatiotemporal queries in an acceptable time.",

Their integration faces many problems such as the structural and the semantic heterogeneity as the processing of these data is difficult using traditional databases and software techniques. In this paper, the data resources are extracted and aggregated from different sources on the web following by using the geospatial ontology to transform this data into RDF format. RDF format is used to integrate the data semantically and construct the big-data semantic model that is used to store data. The major contribution of this research is to aggregate, integrate, and represent geospatial data semantically.

    "abstract": "We address the problem of locating small hydropower dams in an environmentally friendly manner. We propose the use of a multi-objective optimization model to maximize total hydropower production, while limiting negative impacts on river connectivity. Critically, we consider the so called \u201cbackwater effects\u201d that dams have on power generation at nearby upstream sites via changes in water surface profiles. We further account for the likelihood that migratory fish and other aquatic species can successfully pass hydropower dams and other artificial/natural barriers and how this is influenced by backwater effects. Although naturally represented in nonlinear form, we manage through a series of linearization steps to formulate a mixed integer linear programing model. We illustrate the utility of our proposed framework using a case study from England and Wales. Interestingly, we show that for England and Wales, a region heavily impacted by a large number of existing river barriers, that installation of small hydropower dams fitted with even moderately effective fish passes can, in fact, create a win-win situation that results in increased hydropower and improved river connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Most of the countries have access to large amounts of water through rivers and canal. With this renewable resource, electricity can be generated without polluting the environment. Because of the increasing in electricity demand, it is important to estimate the future potential of hydropower. It would then be possible to plan development through mix of energy and implement measures to control the development of the electricity market by the use of sustainable small hydropower projects. In the present paper attempt has been made to review the different types of model developed to evaluate the cost of the small hydropower projects. A review on the different types of correlations developed by earlier investigators has also been presented. The present review attempts to cover the benefits such as clean development mechanism (CDM), internal rate of return (IRR) for financial viability of such projects. A review on the different types of optimization techniques is also been presented to minimize the cost of the installation of SHP projects.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the necessity for developing small hydropower (SHP) plants has emerged due to the increase in environmental concerns. Although there remains an abundant of potential sites for SHP plants in Korea, SHP development has scarcely been performed since the 1990s due to the absence of a suitable approach and economic feasibility. Such a situation encourages decision makers to develop a systematic approach for SHP development. The purpose of this study is to propose a new location analysis methodology to search for potential SHP sites using GSIS (Geo-Spatial Information System). The location analysis in this study focuses on establishing the criteria and methodology for searching for alternative locations rather than selecting the most suitable site among the alternatives. By applying the newly developed methodology, a large area can be precisely surveyed within a short period of time and we expect to be able to use the method in policy making for SHP development by improving the convenience for the user. The newly developed methodology was applied to the upper part of Geum River Basin, in Korea, and found six potential SHP sites. As a fundamental work, this study will be beneficial to the future activation of SHP development.",

    "abstract": "Over 2 billion people, mostly in developing countries, have no access to modern fuels or electricity. The necessity of clean, efficient, reliable and affordable energy services is a crucial issue in developing countries, especially in the context of rural areas where the majority of the people lives. Renewable energy sources in shape of small-scale hydropower systems are a complement or alternative to grid extension. The purpose of this study was to develop a method in order to find potential sites for small-scale hydropower in our study area in southwestern Uganda, by using a Geographical Information System (GIS) and also to investigate the rural energy situation in the area. A GIS is a computerized information system for collecting and handling data in databases as well as a powerful tool for analysis and visualization of geographical data. The results indicate a generally positive attitude to electricity and all interviewees were in great need of its services. Almost all consider themselves to have some means to pay for the electricity even if it is more expensive than what the energy cost today. Our self-designed algorithm identified 250 potential sites for small-scale hydropower stations in the study area. A selection of 14 sites out of these was evaluated and resulted in only three sites fulfilling the defined requirements. All sites met the requirement regarding a certain slope, but the majority lacked a permanent flow of water. The outcome from the evaluation was a result of low quality of the watercourse input data. In conclusion, our method is swift and precise, presupposed reliable input data is available. Presupposed there is a need for electricity and good financing possibilities, small-scale hydropower is an appropriate alternative to assist rural electrification, which will lead to improved standard of living.",

    "abstract": "India being a developing country has witnessed a rapidly growing energy needs owing to fast industrialization. Sustainable and qualitative growth for developing economics and habitat requires increased energy input from various resources while maintaining balance in the ecosystem during exploitation. Paper discusses state of the resource potentials, achievements and various issues related to the power generation in India. The growing concern over environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel based systems, opposition to large hydropower projects on grounds of displacement of land and population, environmental problems with nuclear fuel based systems and the ever-rising shortage of power highlights the need for tapping alternate energy sources for power generation. Amongst the alternate sources utilization of hydropower on a smaller scale (small, mini and micro hydropower) has become the thrust area for sustainable growth in the power sector. Hydropower is an economical and environmentally clean source of renewable energy abundantly available in hilly regions of India. Hydropower stations have an inherent ability for instantaneous starting, stopping, load variations, etc., and help in improving the reliability of power system. Huge hydropower potential in India, yet to be explored is located at inaccessible mountainous region. However, development of this potential is challenging due to difficult and inaccessible terrain profile. Paper presents application of remote sensing data for identification and selection of probable site for hydropower projects. The algorithm for identification and assessment of water resources and its perennial is developed in Visual Basic (VB) platform and it is successfully applied for IRS-1D, LISS III Geo-coded False Color Composite (FCC) satellite image for plain as well as hilly and mountainous regions. Classification of satellite image in to different objects is modeled as the task of clustering based on the intensity of R-G-B values of pixels. Results obtained are presented and compared with the Survey of India Toposheets (53K/2, 53K/3 and 53J/16). Use of Remote sensing data provides a scientific method of hydropower identification and assessment.",

    "abstract": "The combining of evaluation instruments into Geographic Information System (GIS) environments has caused an advancement in solidifying the evaluation and analysis of the hydropower potential existing for the streams in the case of the spatial variability of different factors affecting stream power. GIS spatial analyses are very useful for the development of various methodologies which can be used to calculate hydropower potentials. Geographic Information System based hydrological modeling is conducted on equiareal raster cells by utilizing topographical and meteorological datasets. The input data are then compiled and analyzed using GIS data layers, including topographic characteristics, monthly evaporation and precipitation data. This is essential as it allows for determination of water streams, which have sufficient or high amounts of water and also the potential for showing possible locations where hydropower plants can be constructed. This study aims to analyze the application of a Geographical Information System for computing the theoretical surface hydropower potential by taking Bilecik regional Sakarya Basin of Turkey as a case study. The study has shown that streams found in the Bilecik region have a good potential for hydropower production. In the study area, 85 possible designated locations of small hydropower plants (SHP) have been determined allowing for different annual energy production levels. The results of this study are very significant for the regional planning in collaboration with decision making authorities such as politicians and technical staff, so that hydropower plant construction and operations can be maximized in efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Abundant sensor data are now available online from a wealth of sources, which greatly enhance research efforts on the Digital Earth. The combination of distributed sensor networks and expanding citizen-sensing capabilities provides a more synchronized image of earth's social and physical landscapes. However, it remains difficult for researchers to use such heterogeneous Sensor Webs for scientific applications since data are published by following different standards and protocols and are in arbitrary formats. In this paper, we investigate the core challenges faced when consuming multiple sources for environmental applications using the Linked Data approach. We design and implement a system to achieve better data interoperability and integration by republishing real-world data into linked geo-sensor data. Our contributions include presenting: (1) best practices of re-using and matching the W3C Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontology and other popular ontologies for heterogeneous data modeling in the water resources application domain, (2) a newly developed spatial analysis tool for creating links, and (3) a set of RESTful OGC Sensor Observation Service (SOS) like Linked Data APIs. Our results show how a Linked Sensor Web can be built and used within the integrated water resource decision support application domain.",

    "abstract": "At the present, the situation of shortage of world energy is worsened because of many crucial problems viz., the rapid economic growth in China and India, the revolt in the world's leading trader in crude oil such as Libya, and the explosion at nuclear power plant in Japan. Accordingly, this significantly affects the socioeconomic development of all nations including Thailand, depending upon imported fossil flue, mainly. The exploration and development of renewable energy sources for generating electricity becomes a necessity and urgent. One of the interesting renewable energy sources such as micro hydropower, which requires a small investment and can be easily developed with minimum environmental impact, is considered to be an important alternative energy source for generating electrical power. This study is, therefore, to assess potential area where could be used to develop of a micro hydropower plant in the Chi-river Basin using geographical information systems together with multi-criteria decision making. It was founded that there are seventy potential areas, where could be installed the hydropower generator of more than five kilowatts. The total installation capacity of the generator of these potential areas is 23 megawatts resulting in unit of electricity of 83 gigawatt hours. The potential sites were classified into two categories: (1) the storage project of 28 sites; and (2) the in-river project of 42 sites. These sites were prioritized considering their strengths and weaknesses, in order to develop a pilot project, using multi-criteria decision making with five groups of expertise viz., engineering, economy, environment, socio-economy and community participation. From the prioritization process of community micro hydropower pilot project in the Chi river basin, the top ten ranking were: Chilong-4, Chilong-5, Kanchu-4, Lampao-Dam, Wangyang-Reservoir, Chi-1, Kuichurk-Weir, Thartnoi-Weir, Chi-2 and Chi-3. In addition, the top three ranking were chosen into the intensive community participation process, resulting that the Chilong-4 site was selected to be a pilot project for developing micro hydropower.",

    "abstract": "The power output of run-of-river small hydropower (SHP) developments is very site sensitive and poses several complex challenges, such as inaccessible terrain and numerous possible hydropower scheme alternatives. We developed a geographic information system-based decision support tool that systematically evaluates all possible hydropower scheme alternatives to assist decision makers in assessing the hydropower potential of large data-scarce regions more objectively. A water and energy budget \u2013 based distributed hydrological model and a preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations are integrated and employed in the developed tool. This approach enables the inclusion of both topographical and hydrological factors in the site selection process, allowing the use of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion during site selection. This paper explores the consideration of topographical factors with and without hydrological factors as approaches for optimized site selection. An application of the tool in the case of Kunhar River Basin in Pakistan demonstrates its robustness. For equivalent criteria weights, site selection considering both factors identified a significantly lower number of sites with a shorter waterway length compared to when only topographic factors were considered. However, both approaches identified essentially the same hydropower potential. Notably, the integration with a distributed hydrological model and the incorporation of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion for site selection revealed more economically attractive SHP sites. This approach enables a flexible and rigorous evaluation of the hydropower potential of large poorly gauged basins, which is particularly useful for developing countries.",

    "abstract": "As the determination of criteria weights is important for multiple criteria decision making, a number of attempts have been made to assign weights to criteria. However, whether criterion weight assignment is fair to each criterion and to each alternative is rarely taken into account. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a fair framework in the context of the evidential reasoning approach, which is a type of multiple criteria utility function method. In the fair framework, two strategies are prepared for a decision maker to choose, which are the superior strategy and the inferior strategy. To achieve the objective in line with the selected strategy, two levels of fairness including the fairness among criteria and the fairness among alternatives are defined based on the performances of alternatives on each criterion. By following the two levels of fairness defined, two optimization models are constructed successively to generate possible sets of fair criterion weights. With a view to making all possible sets of fair criterion weights treated in generating a solution, they are incorporated into another optimization model constructed to generate the minimum and maximum expected utilities of each alternative, by which the solution is made with a decision rule preferred by the decision maker. A supplier evaluation problem is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the fair framework.",

    "abstract": "There is a great resurgence of interest all over the world in the development of \u2018small\u2019 hydropower systems (SHS). The surge is essentially propelled by the belief that SHS, which include mini, micro, and picahydel systems, are a source of clean energy with little or no adverse impacts on the environment. This paper presents an overview of SHS and then examines in detail whether the prevalent belief in the great environment-friendliness of SHS is really justified. It is brought out that widespread use of SHS is likely to cause, per kilowatt of power generated, no less significantly adverse environmental impacts than large hydropower systems and some other conventional sources of energy. While supporting the ongoing global efforts to maximize the use of SHS, the authors advocate much greater circumspection than is being exercised at present vis-a-vis SHS. The authors believe that if the likely pitfalls are foreseen before SHS are put to widespread use, and remedial measures taken accordingly, it may save the world from considerable disillusionment and environmental damage.",

The high frequency and continuous unbound nature of data streams leads to challenges when deriving knowledge from the underlying observations. This paper presents (1) a state of the art review into visual analytics of geospatial, spatio-temporal streaming data, and (2) proposes a framework based on the identified gaps from the review. The framework consists of (1) the data model that characterizes the sensor observation data, (2) the user model, which addresses the user queries and manages domain knowledge, (3) the design model, which handles the patterns that can be uncovered from the data and corresponding visualizations, and (4) the visualization model, which handles the rendering of the data. The conclusion from the visualization model is that streaming sensor observations require tools that can handle multivariate, multiscale, and time series displays. The design model reveals that the most useful patterns are those that show relationships, anomalies, and aggregations of the data. The user model highlights the need for handling missing data, dealing with high frequency changes, as well as the ability to review retrospective changes.",

    "abstract": "In the last decade, European attractive policies are favoring the construction of new run-off hydro-power plants. The realization cost of these plants is quite low in mountain areas thanks to small water discharges and high gross heads. For this reason, small rivers have been strongly exploited without considering an optimal use of the resource. Nowadays, available sites are often in areas with low accessibility and a greater specific cost of civil engineering works. However, during the planning of new small hydro-power plants, the dependency of physical, technical, legal and financial variable on space is often not assessed. The tool presented in this paper addresses this gap to support the planning of run-off-river plants. The method improves on previous approaches by (1) integrating all the legal, technical and financial analysis in a GIS tool, and (2) trying to validate the site-specific model with local knowledge. The tool is applied to the Gesso and Vermenagna valleys in the Alps. Information and data were collected and discussed with local stakeholders in order to improve the model results.",

How can a world of 10 billion people be provided with adequate supplies of energy, cleanly, safely and substantially? There is a growing consensus that renewable energy sources will be a very important part of the answer. The growing interest in renewables has been prompted, in part, by increasing concern over the pollution, resource depletion and possible climate change implications of our continuing use of conventional fossil and nuclear fuels. Recent technological developments have also improved the cost-effectiveness of many of the renewables, making their economic prospects look increasingly attractive. It describes the achievement and progress made in hydropower, biomass conversion, geothermal, solar thermal technology, wind energy conversion, and the increasing usage of photovoltaics. It is evident that global warming is setting in and is going to change the climate, as well as the terrain of many countries, unless drastic measures are taken. The Kyoto meeting emphasized the importance of limiting CO2 emissions and to abide by some form of agreement to reduce emissions.

El potencial econ\u00f3mico de las peque\u00f1as unidades generadoras de energ\u00eda hidroel\u00e9ctrica solo se estima en 7.5\u201311.0 teravatios-hora por a\u00f1o, de las cuales solo se produce el 5\\% (Programa de las Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo (PNUD) Kazajst\u00e1n, Recursos H\u00eddricos de Kazajst\u00e1n en el nuevo milenio, Informe \\# UNDPKAZ 07, Almaty, 2004). Sin embargo, su uso sostenible exige una reestructuraci\u00f3n completa del sistema existente de asignaci\u00f3n y uso de los recursos h\u00eddricos naturales, tal como sugiere Z\u00e0u\u00ecrbek (Programa nacional para la gesti\u00f3n de los recursos h\u00eddricos en la Rep\u00fablica de Kazajst\u00e1n. KazNatAGRU, Almaty,Our knowledge management system has the aim to support the user to develop credible and defensible water resource management plans in line with IWRM objectives and in particular:(a) Describe water resources and identify actual and emerging problems of water pollution and water use inefficiencies as well as infrastructure needs. (b) Formulate plans and set priorities for water quality, water use management, and infrastructure needs. (c) Develop and implement water quality management programs, water allocation strategies, and river basin asset management plans. Such applications (Argote et al., Manag Sci 49(4):571\u2013582, 2003; Boddy et al., Autom Constr 16(5):596\u2013606, 2007; Dalcanale et al., Environ Manag 47(3):443\u2013455, 2011; Liao, Expert Syst Appl 25(2):155\u2013164, 2003; Sandwahalia et al. 2008; Toman, Water Resour Manag IV 103:667\u2013676, 2007) with the integration of a Geo-Information Systems (Chen et al., J Hydro Environ Res 4(3):253\u2013264, 2010) have significant potential as a platform for managing environmental, water resource, and infrastructure data. This mapping and geo-spatial analysis of information will see further advancements by integrating models and near real-time remote monitoring systems (Burman, Image Signal Process Remote Sens V 3871:348\u2013357, 1999; Chen et al. 2008; Legleiter et al. Earth Surf Process Landf 34:1039\u20131059, 2009; Lyzenga, Shallow-water reflectance modeling with applications to remote sensing of ocean floor. Proceeding of 13th international Symposium on remote sensing of environment, pp 583\u2013602, 1979) thus providing a wide range of data modalities to enable high-speed visualization and analytics. To be tested as a prototype, this project will result in a comprehensive technical and economic feasibility study for investing in hydropower generation by quantifying flow volumes, identifying potential sites for water storage, and assessing geographic elevation gradients that are suitable to produce electricity with small hydropower stations.",
