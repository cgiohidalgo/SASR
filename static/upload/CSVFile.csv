For the engineering criteria, the project locations are found by GIS in visual basic platform, and then economic evaluations of the selected projects are performed. Next, the environmental parameters are used to rank the projects by total weighted scores. Finally, a social impact study at the potential sites is conducted based on the public participation process, i.e. questionnaire survey and focus group discussions.

zaidi_identifying_2018{,"The recent global energy crisis has provoked a need to explore alternate energy sources including run-of-the-river hydropower projects. To derive maximum payback for a given investment, finding the most advantageous siting of power plants is imperative. If a selection of potential sites misses some of the apparently indistinct sites with significant power potential, there is a chance of acquiring only partial benefits out of these investments. A review of the existing methods for evaluating power potential of a river is discussed in this paper with their limitations along with a new proposed approach. The new approach can be used to evaluate different installation schemes along a river to assess run-of-the-river hydropower potentials using geospatial data techniques to select sites exhibiting higher total hydropower potential. The case study of Kunhar River, located in the northern part of Pakistan, presents the applicability of the approach. Open source Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission (ASTER)’s digital elevation model (DEM) and regional hydrologic gauged data are used for identifying the best locations for hydropower plants, demonstrating this approach is substantially more cost effective and robust compared to other field based assessment. Replicating the proposed approach for other locations is easy following the step-by-step method presented in this paper and giving consideration to the limitations described. This study may provide guidelines for the development of cost-effective and energy efficient hydropower projects.

The system considers the hydrological, topographical, geotechnical, environmental, energy, economic and social aspects of the target site. A detailed analysis is made of the hydrological model that employs a rainfall run-off model for small catchment analysis; the energy planning favors a two-turbine method to determine the maximum energy production during demand peaks, and the economic aspects show that the costs of energy generated by MHP plants are comparable to those from rural grid systems and lower than those from from diesel generators. Thus, the use of the hydro-power resources of the small catchments of Amazonia combined with the minimization of the environmental impacts caused by MHP not only fulfills the energy demand of the small communities of region, but is also viable economically along with job creation and revenue generation, and it supports the perspective of sustainable development.",article,,,Decision support system for micro-hydro power plants in the {Amazon,,,25--33,,"Blanco, Claudio J.

muller_bridging_2016{,"Rural electrification in developing countries is often hampered by major information gaps between local communities and urban centers, where technical expertise and funding are concentrated. The tool presented in this paper addresses these gaps to support the implementation of off-grid micro hydropower infrastructure. Specifically, we present a method to site, size and evaluate the potential for micro hydropower based on remote sensing data. The method improves on previous approaches by (i) incorporating the effect of hillslope topography on the optimal layout of the infrastructure, and (ii) accounting for the constraints imposed by streamflow variability and local electricity demand on the optimal size of the plants. An assessment of the method’s performance against 148 existing schemes indicates that it correctly identifies the most promising locations for hydropower in Nepal, but does not generally reproduce the specific design features of constructed plants, which are affected by site-specific constraints.

Accordingly, stream processing should be performed with consideration into both temporal and spatial factors. However, existing researches have a limitation of processing spatial queries since they focus on the temporal processing of streaming data. To support spatiotemporal query processing on semantic data streams, we propose a query language, which integrates temporal and geospatial properties.

We further account for the likelihood that migratory fish and other aquatic species can successfully pass hydropower dams and other artificial/natural barriers and how this is influenced by backwater effects. Although naturally represented in nonlinear form, we manage through a series of linearization steps to formulate a mixed integer linear programing model. We illustrate the utility of our proposed framework using a case study from England and Wales.

The growing concern over environmental degradation caused by fossil fuel based systems, opposition to large hydropower projects on grounds of displacement of land and population, environmental problems with nuclear fuel based systems and the ever-rising shortage of power highlights the need for tapping alternate energy sources for power generation. Amongst the alternate sources utilization of hydropower on a smaller scale (small, mini and micro hydropower) has become the thrust area for sustainable growth in the power sector. Hydropower is an economical and environmentally clean source of renewable energy abundantly available in hilly regions of India. Hydropower stations have an inherent ability for instantaneous starting, stopping, load variations, etc., and help in improving the reliability of power system. Huge hydropower potential in India, yet to be explored is located at inaccessible mountainous region.

Accordingly, this significantly affects the socioeconomic development of all nations including Thailand, depending upon imported fossil flue, mainly. The exploration and development of renewable energy sources for generating electricity becomes a necessity and urgent. One of the interesting renewable energy sources such as micro hydropower, which requires a small investment and can be easily developed with minimum environmental impact, is considered to be an important alternative energy source for generating electrical power. This study is, therefore, to assess potential area where could be used to develop of a micro hydropower plant in the Chi-river Basin using geographical information systems together with multi-criteria decision making. It was founded that there are seventy potential areas, where could be installed the hydropower generator of more than five kilowatts. The total installation capacity of the generator of these potential areas is 23 megawatts resulting in unit of electricity of 83 gigawatt hours. The potential sites were classified into two categories: (1) the storage project of 28 sites; and (2) the in-river project of 42 sites. These sites were prioritized considering their strengths and weaknesses, in order to develop a pilot project, using multi-criteria decision making with five groups of expertise viz., engineering, economy, environment, socio-economy and community participation. From the prioritization process of community micro hydropower pilot project in the Chi river basin, the top ten ranking were: Chilong-4, Chilong-5, Kanchu-4, Lampao-Dam, Wangyang-Reservoir, Chi-1, Kuichurk-Weir, Thartnoi-Weir, Chi-2 and Chi-3.

moiz_systematic_2018{,"The power output of run-of-river small hydropower (SHP) developments is very site sensitive and poses several complex challenges, such as inaccessible terrain and numerous possible hydropower scheme alternatives. We developed a geographic information system-based decision support tool that systematically evaluates all possible hydropower scheme alternatives to assist decision makers in assessing the hydropower potential of large data-scarce regions more objectively. A water and energy budget – based distributed hydrological model and a preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluations are integrated and employed in the developed tool. This approach enables the inclusion of both topographical and hydrological factors in the site selection process, allowing the use of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion during site selection. This paper explores the consideration of topographical factors with and without hydrological factors as approaches for optimized site selection. An application of the tool in the case of Kunhar River Basin in Pakistan demonstrates its robustness. For equivalent criteria weights, site selection considering both factors identified a significantly lower number of sites with a shorter waterway length compared to when only topographic factors were considered. However, both approaches identified essentially the same hydropower potential. Notably, the integration with a distributed hydrological model and the incorporation of hydropower potential as a maximizing criterion for site selection revealed more economically attractive SHP sites.

However, whether criterion weight assignment is fair to each criterion and to each alternative is rarely taken into account. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a fair framework in the context of the evidential reasoning approach, which is a type of multiple criteria utility function method. In the fair framework, two strategies are prepared for a decision maker to choose, which are the superior strategy and the inferior strategy. To achieve the objective in line with the selected strategy, two levels of fairness including the fairness among criteria and the fairness among alternatives are defined based on the performances of alternatives on each criterion. By following the two levels of fairness defined, two optimization models are constructed successively to generate possible sets of fair criterion weights. With a view to making all possible sets of fair criterion weights treated in generating a solution, they are incorporated into another optimization model constructed to generate the minimum and maximum expected utilities of each alternative, by which the solution is made with a decision rule preferred by the decision maker.

This paper presents an overview of SHS and then examines in detail whether the prevalent belief in the great environment-friendliness of SHS is really justified. It is brought out that widespread use of SHS is likely to cause, per kilowatt of power generated, no less significantly adverse environmental impacts than large hydropower systems and some other conventional sources of energy. While supporting the ongoing global efforts to maximize the use of SHS, the authors advocate much greater circumspection than is being exercised at present vis-a-vis SHS.
