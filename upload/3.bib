abstract = {Source control repositories, bug repositories, archived communications, deployment logs, and code repositories are examples of software repositories that are commonly available for most software projects. The Mining Software Repositories (MSR) field analyzes and cross-links the rich data available in these repositories to uncover interesting and actionable information about software systems. By transforming these repositories from static record-keeping ones into active repositories, we can guide decision processes in modern software projects. For example, data in source control repositories, traditionally used to archive code, could be linked with data in bug repositories to help practitioners propagate complex changes and to warn them about risky code based on prior changes and bugs. In this paper, we present a brief history of the MSR field and discuss several recent achievements and results of using MSR techniques to support software research and practice. We then discuss the various opportunities and challenges that lie in the road ahead for this important and emerging field. {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} 2008 IEEE.},

Companies look into every aspect for effective project management. Practitioners have started considering human aspect equally important in the product, process, people triad. Human aspect has become top concern for companies' management since companies have realized that software is a product which is completely people driven. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the data mining area, where the objective is the discovery of knowledge that is correct and of high benefit for management. In this paper, we propose a model for high capability performance . This approach has proven to have positive impact on software development. It is a experimental and empirically driven model that builds a project team capability to achieve the desired software quality within the time and cost constraints. It is integration of personnel capability and post training. The capability and training are co-supportive and work in conjunction to ensure project success.},

abstract = {Abbreviation Completion is a novel technique to improve the efficiency of code-writing by supporting code completion of multiple keywords based on non-predefined abbreviated inputâ€”a different approach from conventional code completion that finds one keyword at a time based on an exact character match. Abbreviated input is expanded into keywords by a Hidden Markov Model learned from a corpus of existing code. The technique does not require the user to memorize abbreviations and provides incremental feedback of the most likely completions. This paper presents the algorithm for abbreviation completion, integrated with a new user interface for multiple-keyword completion. We tested the system by sampling 3000 code lines from open source projects and found that more than 98{\%} of the code lines could be resolved from acronym-like abbreviations. A user study found 30{\%} reduction in time usage and 41{\%} reduction of keystrokes over conventional code completion. Code Completion; Hidden Ma},

abstract = {Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, decreases grain yield and quality in wheat and barley. Disease severity, deoxynivalenol (DON), fungal biomass, and transcript accumulation were examined in a wheat near-isogenic line pair carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele for the chromosome 3BS FHB-resistance quantitative trait locus (Fhb1). Fhb1 restricts spread of disease symptoms but does not provide resistance to initial infection or initial DON accumulation. Wheat exhibits both induction and repression of large sets of gene transcripts during F. graminearum infection. In addition, a difference in the general timing of transcript accumulation in plants carrying either the resistant or susceptible allele at the Fhb1 locus was detected, and 14 wheat gene transcripts were detected that exhibited accumulation differences between the resistant and susceptible alleles. These results indicate that these may be host responses that differentiate the resistant from the susceptible interaction. Comparative analysis of the wheat-F. graminearum and the barley-F. graminearum interactions revealed a large set of conserved transcript accumulation patterns. However, we also detected gene transcripts that were repressed in wheat but not in barley. Based on the disease symptoms, transcript accumulation data, and comparative analysis of the barley and wheat host response to F. graminearum infection, we developed an integrated model for the interactions of wheat and barley with F. graminearum.},
